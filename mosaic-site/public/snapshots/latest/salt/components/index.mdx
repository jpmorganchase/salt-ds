Our components are built with accessibility in mind. Each one has comprehensive
supporting documentation with usage guidance, examples and props.
We’re constantly adding new components so check back if what you need isn’t
available or [get in touch](../support-and-contributions/index) if you have any feedback or requests.

In addition to the public libraries in the [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/@jpmorgan_salt),
if you’re a J.P. Morgan employee, you can view the [Salt component files](https://www.figma.com/files/project/72279506)
in Figma when logged in to the JPMC network.
They include accessibility and design specifications for each component,
with designs for light and dark modes in all four densities.
