Lint rule to strictly only allow for CSS attributes and merged states (`activeDisabled`, `blurSelected`, `partialDisabled`, `selectedDisabled`) to be in camel case within tokens

Deprecated `--size-salt-adornmentGap`; replaced with `--salt-size-adornment-gap`
Deprecated `--size-focused-outlineInset`; replaced with `--salt-focused-inset`

Added missing token `--salt-size-container-spacing` to docs
