Improved Tab's overflow behavior and accessibility:

- Tab lists should now collapse in more scenarios.
- Tabs selected from the overflow menu should be focused more consistently.
- When a tab is removed, focus moved to the next tab in the tab list more consistently.
- When a selected tab is removed, the next tab in the tab list should be selected more consistently.
