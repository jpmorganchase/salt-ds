Add Toast and ToastContent.

Displays a small pop-up notification that’s usually short-lived and shown in response to a user action or system event unrelated to the user’s current focus.

```tsx
<Toast>
  <ToastContent>Toast content</ToastContent>
  <Button variant="secondary">
    <CloseIcon />
  </Button>
</Toast>
```
