Added ComboBox component to labs

Combo Box helps users select an item from a large list of options without scrolling. The typeahead functionality makes this selection quicker, easier, and reduces errors.
Users can see a list of available options when they click on the component and filter the list as they type. Once theyâ€™ve made their selection, it populates the field and the overlay list closes.

```

const handleChange = (event: SyntheticEvent, data: { value: string }) => {
console.log("input value changed", data);
};

const handleSelect = (event: SyntheticEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
console.log("selected item", event.currentTarget.value);
};
return (
<ComboBoxNext onChange={handleChange} onSelect={handleSelect} source={['Option 1','Option 2','Option 3']} />
);

```
