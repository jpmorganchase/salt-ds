Extended support to ag grid v32

- Added support for new active button in floating filter, with adjusted floating filter focus style. Updated `--ag-icon-font-code-filter` to use outline version of filter icon to accommodate active state using filled version.
- Fixed apply / reset panel buttons due to attribute change
- Added "ag-grid-community" as `peerDependencies` to enforce minimum v28 support
