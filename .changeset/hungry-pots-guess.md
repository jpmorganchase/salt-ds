Added `FileDropZone` to Core

`FileDropZone` provides a target area for users to drag and drop files, such as documents or images, and automatically uploads them to the web application.

```tsx
<FileDropZone>
    <FileDropZoneIcon />
    <strong>Drop files here or</strong>
    <FileDropZoneTrigger />
  </FileDropZone>
```
