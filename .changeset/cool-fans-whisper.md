Added `Pill` to Core

`PillNext` is a small visual element that can contain descriptive text and an icon. You can use pills to label, tag or categorize content. With pills, users can trigger actions, make selections or filter results.

```tsx
v  <Pill onClick={handleClick}>Clickable Pill</Pill>
```
