Based on consumer feedback, we have enhanced our solid button's hove state to include a fill color change along with the border, improving visual affordance. Additionally, for the transparent button, the border is now removed in both hover and active states, and the fill uses a subtler style—applying a black alpha in light mode and a white alpha in dark mode.
