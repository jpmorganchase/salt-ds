Added `sentiment` (accented, neutral, positive, negative, caution) and `appearance` (solid, bordered, transparent) props for Button.

_Note:_ Button's `variant` prop is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.

| `variant`   | `appearance`  | `sentiment` |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| `cta`       | `solid`       | `accented`  |
| `primary`   | `solid`       | `neutral`   |
| `secondary` | `transparent` | `neutral`   |
