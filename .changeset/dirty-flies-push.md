- Added row validation status support via classes: `.salt-grid-row-error`,`.salt-grid-row-warning`,`.salt-grid-row-success`.
- Added cell validation status support via classes: `.salt-grid-cell-error`,`.salt-grid-cell-warning`,`.salt-grid-cell-success`, when used together with `.editable-cell`.
- Refactored secondary and zebra variant to better align with ag grid CSS variables. This fixes row selection border color for zebra variant.
