- Added row validation status support via classes: `.error-row`, `.warning-row` and `.success-row`.
- Added cell validation status support via classes: `.error-cell`, `.warning-cell` and `.success-cell`, when used together with `.editable-cell`.
- Refactored secondary and zebra variant to better align with ag grid CSS variables. This fixes row selection border color for zebra variant.
