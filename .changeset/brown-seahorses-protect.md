Introduced a Selectable Pill variant that enables users to select multiple items within a PillGroup. 
This enhancement allows for multi-selection functionality, making it easier to capture user choices in grouped pill interfaces.

Usage example:
```
<PillGroup>
 <Pill value="one">Pill 1</Pill>
 <Pill value="two">Pill 2</Pill>
 <Pill value="three">Pill 3</Pill>
</PillGroup>
```
