Introduced a PillGroup component.
This enhancement allows for multi-selection functionality, making it easier to capture user choices in grouped pill interfaces.

Usage example:

```
<PillGroup>
 <Pill value="one">Pill 1</Pill>
 <Pill value="two">Pill 2</Pill>
 <Pill value="three">Pill 3</Pill>
</PillGroup>
```
