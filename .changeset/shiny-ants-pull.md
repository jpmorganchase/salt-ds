"@salt-ds/icons": patch
---

Reexporting all the icons from Figma. This has caused the following:

- The "9" in the `SortNumAscendIcon` is no longer cut off.
- The arrow in the `PlaceInIcon` is no longer too short.
- The `SaltShakerIcon` and `SaltShakerSolidIcon` have the correct viewport and are now slightly bigger.
- The waves in the `SignalIcon` are now visible.
- The arrow in the `TearOutIcon` is no longer too short.
