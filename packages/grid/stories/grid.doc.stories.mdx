# Grid

A Grid presents tabular information that has columns and rows.
Grid is particularly useful if the tabular information is editable or interactive.
Grid provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation, content editing, selection, and copy and paste.

Grid is virtualized. Only the visible part is rendered to the DOM.

## Configuring Grid

Run command below to install `@jpmorganchase/uitk-grid` package.

```sh
yarn add @jpmorganchase/uitk-grid;
```

```sh
npm install @jpmorganchase/uitk-grid;
```

Use the following call to import Grid.

```
import { Grid } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-grid";
```

Note: ensure CSS `height` property for `.grid` has been set appropriately to see grid on screen

### Props

<ArgsTable of={Grid} />

## Grid variants

Grid contains two variants:

1. `primary`: the default mode. Zebra is available on `primary` variant, i.e. `zebra={true}`
2. `secondary`

Column separators can be enabled using `columnSeparators` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--grid-variants" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Columns

Grid columns can be configured using the `GridColumn` component.

The Grid package contains three types of predefined columns:

1. `RowSelectionCheckboxColumn`: cell values of type `RowSelectionCheckboxCellValue` contain checkboxes, allows multiple selection and values are left aligned by default.
2. `RowSelectionRadioColumn`: cell values of type `RowSelectionRadioCellValue` contain radio buttons, allows single selection only and values are left aligned by default.
3. `NumericColumn`: cell values of type `NumericCellValue`, values are right aligned only.

Each one of them renders a `GridColumn` with a specific set of props.
You can easily create any project-specific column types tailored to your needs using the same approach.

#### GridColumn props

<ArgsTable of={GridColumn} />{" "}

### Column groups

Columns can be grouped using the `ColumnGroup` component.

Note: whenever a `ColumnGroup` component is present, all other Grid's children will also need to be wrapped within a `ColumnGroup` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--column-groups" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Rows

Grid rows are created by providing an array of objects in the `rowData` property of the grid.
`rowData` also accepts sparse arrays.
When used in combination with the `onVisibleRowRangeChange` callback this allows for lazy loading (server-side data) scenarios.

[Here's an example](https://uitk.pages.dev/?path=/story/grid-new-grid--server-side-data) that details using sparse array and `onVisibleRowRangeChange` callback.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--server-side-data" />
</Canvas>

### Row selection

Grid supports three variants of row selection:

1. Single row selection
2. Multi-row selection
3. None (rows cannot be selected)

`RowSelectionCheckboxColumn` is useful in `multi` row selection mode, and `RowSelectionRadioColumn` works best in `single` row selection mode.
Both are optional.

#### Uncontrolled mode

In [uncontrolled mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) you can provide `defaultSelectedRowIdxs` and the grid maintains the selection state. It accepts `number[]`, and works only when `rowSelectionMode` is `single` or `multi`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--row-selection-modes" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

#### Controlled mode

In [controlled mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) you can provide `selectedRowIdxs` and update it when `onRowsSelected` callback is invoked.
Below is an example of how to use controlled selection mode to synchronise selection in two grids.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    id="grid-new-grid--row-selection-controlled"
    decorators={[withFlexGap]}
  />
</Canvas>

### Cell customization

Grid allows the use of any renderable react components for cell customization. There is two ways to customize cell appearance:

1. `cellValueComponent` (recommended)
2. `cellComponent`

The `cellValueComponent` property of `GridColumn` component is the most convenient extension point. It handles cell values and functionalities like on hover highlighting, selection, cursor and focus.
Below is an example of custom components applied to `cellValueComponent` of "Bid/Ask", "Percentage" and "Buttons" columns, [more details here](https://uitk.pages.dev/?path=/story/grid-new-grid--cell-customization).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--cell-customization" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

Second way to customize cell appearance is the `cellComponent` property.
Unlike `cellValueComponent` it replaces the entire cell element rather than its content and allows you to implement more radical customization scenarios.
Please note that if you override `cellComponent` you will need to handle all basic functionality typically provided by the default cell implementation,
therefore it is recommended that you only use `cellComponent` if `cellValueComponent` does not provide enough flexibility.

### Header customization

Column headers and column group headers can be customized using the `headerValueComponent` property which is demonstrated by the grid below.

- The "Items sold" column group has a group of toggle buttons that change the appearance of the group between "monthly", "quarterly" and "summary" modes.
- The "Item" column group has a button to toggle between pinned and unpinned modes.
- The "Name" and "Price" columns have custom headers that indicate sort direction.

This grid also shows an example of a custom cell displaying a basic chart. Switch the "Items sold" column to "summary" mode to see it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--header-customization" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Editable cells

Grid allows you to make cell values editable in place.

Use the `CellEditor` (a non-rendered) component as a child of `GridColumn` to make the column editable.
`CellEditor` is expected to have one child representing the specific editor component to use for the column.
The child of the `CellEditor` component gets rendered in the focused cell when the grid goes to edit mode.

We have [three sample components](https://uitk.pages.dev/?path=/story/grid-new-grid--editable-cells) created for use as `CellEditor`'s child,
i.e. `TextCellEditor`, `DropdownCellEditor` and `NumericCellEditor`.
You can easily create any components tailored to your needs using the same approach.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--editable-cells" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

To trigger edit mode on cells on your...

- keyboard: `backspace` key _or_ `F2` key _or_ simply start typing
- mouse: double click

### Pagination

[Implement pagination](https://uitk.pages.dev/?path=/story/lab-pagination--default-pagination) using the `Paginator` component. It is not a feature of the grid itself.

```
import { Pagination, Paginator } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-lab";

// Pagination props
count: number
page?: number
onPageChange?: ((page: number) => void)
initialPage?: number
compact?: Boolean

// Paginator props
boundaryCount?: number;
siblingCount?: number;
showPreviousNext?: boolean;
FormFieldProps?: Partial<FormFieldProps>;
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--grid-pagination" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Writing tests for Grid component

Grid utilises virtualization to load content and renders only whatâ€™s in the viewport.
As previously fetched data leave the viewport, so do the DOM notes.

Note that if your test expects an element to be rendered, and it is out of the viewport, the test will not find the element - that is expected behaviour.
To make tests work, ensure your grid is big enough and have scrolling implemented, closely mimicking how a user would experience using it.

### CSS Class

<CSSClassTable of={Grid} />

### Characteristics used

<CharacteristicUsage of={Grid} />

### --uitkGrid CSS custom property API

The default styling values for most Grid attributes are provided by the theme variables. A smaller number of attributes
use hard-coded values local to Grid. Both of these can be overridden, see Theme documentation for detailed usage guidance.

The CSS custom properties below are consumed by Grid, but not defined by Grid. They can be defined via a container or
a custom class name to override grid styling. They will always take precedence over default styles, whether from theme variables
or declared locally. Again, see Theme documentation for guidance on when to use variables from the custom property API.

The grid below is editable. Change the values of CSS variables to view their effect on the grid.
