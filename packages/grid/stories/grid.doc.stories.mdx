# Grid

A Grid presents tabular information that has columns and rows.
Grid is particularly useful if the tabular information is editable or interactive.
Grid provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation, content editing, selection, and copy and paste.

Grid is virtualized. Only the visible part is rendered to the DOM.

## Configuring Grid

Use the following call to import Grid.

```
import { Grid } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-grid";
```

### Props

<ArgsTable of={Grid} />

## Grid variants

Grid contains two variants `primary` and `secondary`. If not specified, the default value is `primary`.
Zebra can be enabled for the `primary` variant.

Column separators can be enabled using `columnSeparators` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--grid-variants" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Columns

Grid columns can be configured using the `GridColumn` component.

The Grid package contains the following types of predefined columns:

- RowSelectionCheckboxColumn
- RowSelectionRadioColumn
- NumericColumn

Each one of them renders a `GridColumn` with a specific set of props.
You can easily create any project-specific column types using the same approach.

#### GridColumn props

<ArgsTable of={GridColumn} />{" "}

### Column groups

Columns can be grouped using the `ColumnGroup` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--column-groups" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Rows

Grid rows are created by providing an array of objects in the `rowData` property of the grid.
`rowData` also accepts sparse arrays.
When used in combination with the `onVisibleRowRangeChange` callback this allows for lazy loading (server-side data) scenarios.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--server-side-data" />
</Canvas>

### Row selection

Grid supports three variants of row selection:

- Single row selection
- Multi-row selection
- None (rows cannot be selected)

`RowSelectionCheckboxColumn` is useful in `multi` row selection mode, and `RowSelectionRadioColumn` works best in `single` row selection mode.
Both are optional.

#### Uncontrolled mode

In uncontrolled mode you can provide `defaultSelectedRowIdxs` and the grid maintains the selection state

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--row-selection-modes" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

#### Controlled mode

In controlled mode you can provide `selectedRowIdxs` and update it when `onRowsSelected` callback is invoked.
Below is an example of how to use controlled selection mode to synchronise selection in two grids.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    id="grid-new-grid--row-selection-controlled"
    decorators={[withFlexGap]}
  />
</Canvas>

### Cell selection

In addition to row selection, Grid supports cell range selection using keyboard and mouse.
Cell range selection is controlled by the `cellSelectionMode` property.

### Cell customisation

Grid allows the use of any react components for cell rendering.

The `cellValueComponent` property of `GridColumn` component is the most convenient extension point.
Below is an example of custom components applied to `cellValueComponent` of "Bid/Ask", "Percentage" and "Buttons" columns.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--cell-customization" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

Another way to customise cell appearance is the `cellComponent` property.
Unlike `cellValueComponent` it replaces the entire cell element rather than its content and allows you to implement more radical customisation scenarios.
Please note that if you override `cellComponent` you will need to handle all basic functionality typically provided by the default cell implementation,
therefore it is recommended that you only use `cellComponent` if `cellValueComponent` does not provide enough flexibility.

### Header customization

Column headers and column group headers can be customised using the `headerValueComponent` property which is demonstrated by the grid below.

- The "Items sold" column group has a group of toggle buttons that change the appearance of the group between "monthly", "quarterly" and "summary" modes.
- The "Item" column group has a button to toggle between pinned and unpinned modes.
- The "Name" and "Price" columns have custom headers that indicate sort direction.

This grid also shows an example of a custom cell displaying a basic chart. Switch the "Items sold" column to "summary" mode to see it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--header-customization" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Editable cells

Grid allows you to make cell values editable in place.
Use the `CellEditor` component as a child of `GridColumn` to make the column editable.
`CellEditor` is a non-rendered component.
`CellEditor` is expected to have one child representing the specific editor component to use for the column, e.g. `TextCellEditor`, `DropdownCellEditor` or `NumericCellEditor`.
The child of the `CellEditor` component gets rendered in the focused cell when the grid goes to edit mode.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--editable-cells" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Pagination

Implement pagination using the `Paginator` component. It is not a feature of the grid itself.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="grid-new-grid--grid-pagination" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### CSS Class

<CSSClassTable of={Grid} />

### Characteristics used

<CharacteristicUsage of={Grid} />

### --uitkGrid CSS custom property API

The default styling values for most Grid attributes are provided by the theme variables. A smaller number of attributes
use hard-coded values local to Grid. Both of these can be overridden, see Theme documentation for detailed usage guidance.

The CSS custom properties below are consumed by Grid, but not defined by Grid. They can be defined via a container or
a custom class name to override grid styling. They will always take precedence over default styles, whether from theme variables
or declared locally. Again, see Theme documentation for guidance on when to use variables from the custom property API.

The grid below is editable. Change the values of CSS variables to view their effect on the grid.
