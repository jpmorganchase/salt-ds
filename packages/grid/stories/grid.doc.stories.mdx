# Grid

A Grid presents tabular information that has columns and rows.
Grid is particularly useful if the tabular information is editable or interactive.
Grid provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation, content editing, selection, copy and paste.

Grid is virtualized. Only the visible part is rendered to the DOM.

## Configuring Grid

Use the following call to import Grid.

```
import { Grid } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-grid";
```

### Props

<ArgsTable of={Grid} />

## Grid variants

Grid contains two variants `primary` and `secondary`. If not specified, the default value is `primary`.
Zebra can be enabled for the `primary` variant.

Column separators can be enabled using `columnSeparators` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid Variants" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <GridVariantExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Columns

Grid columns can be configured using `GridColumn` component.

Grid package contains the following types of predefined columns:

- RowSelectionCheckboxColumn
- RowSelectionRadioColumn
- NumericColumn

Every one of them renders a `GridColumn` with a specific set of props.
Users can easily create any project-specific column types using the same approach.

#### GridColumn props

<ArgsTable of={GridColumn} />{" "}

### Column groups

Columns can be grouped using the `ColumnGroup` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid with grouped columns" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <GridColumnGroupExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Rows

Grid rows are created by providing an array of objects as `rowData` property of the grid.
`rowData` accepts sparse arrays too.
In combination with `onVisibleRowRangeChange` callback this allows lazy loading (server-side data) scenarios.

### Row selection

Grid supports three variants of row selection:

- Single row selection
- Multi-row selection
- None (rows cannot be selected)

`RowSelectionCheckboxColumn` is useful in `multi` row selection mode and `RowSelectionRadioColumn` - in `single` row selection mode.
Both are optional though.

#### Uncontrolled mode

In uncontrolled mode user provides `defaultSelectedRowIdxs` and the grid maintains selection state

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid row selection modes" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <RowSelectionModesExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Controlled mode

In controlled mode user provides `selectedRowIdxs` and updates it when `onRowsSelected` callback is invoked.
Below is an example of how to use controlled selection mode to synchronise selection in two grids.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid row selection controlled mode" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <ControlledRowSelectionExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Cell selection

In addition to row selection, Grid supports cell range selection using keyboard and mouse.
Cell range selection is controlled by `cellSelectionMode` property.

### Cell customisation

Grid allows using any react components for cell rendering.

The `cellValueComponent` property of `GridColumn` component is the most convenient extension point.
Below is an example of custom components applied to `cellValueComponent` of "Bid/Ask", "Percentage" and "Buttons" columns.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Cell customization" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <CellCustomizationExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Another way to customise cell appearance is the `cellComponent` property.
Unlike `cellValueComponent` it replaces the entire cell element rather than its content and allows to implement more radical customisation scenarios.
However all basic functionality typically provided by the default cell implementation needs to be handled by the user if `cellComponent` is overridden.
Therefore it is recommended to use `cellComponent` only if `cellValueComponent` does not provide enough flexibility.

### Header customization

Column headers and column group headers can be customised using the `headerValueComponent` property which is demonstrated by the grid below.

- "Items sold" column group has a group of toggle buttons that change the appearance of the group between "montly", "quarterly" and "summary" modes.
- "Item" column group has a button to toggle between pinned and unpinned modes.
- "Name" and "Price" columns have custom headers that indicate sort direction.

This grid also shows an example of a custom cell displaying a basic chart. Switch the "Items sold" to "summary" mode to see it.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Header customization" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <HeaderCustomizationExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Editable cells

Grid allows editing cell values in place.
`CellEditor` component used as a child of `GridColumn` makes the column editable.
`CellEditor` is a non-rendered component.
`CellEditor` is expected to have one child representing the specific editor component to use for the column, e.g. `TextCellEditor`, `DropdownCellEditor` or `NumericCellEditor`.
The child of the `CellEditor` component gets rendered in the focused cell when the grid goes to edit mode.

### HTML Anatomy of a Grid

export const Link = ({ children, to, ...props }) => (
  <a {...props} href={to}>
    {children}
  </a>
);

### CSS Class

<CSSClassTable of={Grid} />

### Characteristics used

<CharacteristicUsage of={Grid} />

### --uitkGrid CSS custom property API

The default styling values for most Grid attributes are provided by the theme variables. A smaller number of attributes
use hard-coded values local to Grid. Both of these can be overridden, see Theme documentation for detailed usage guidance.

The CSS custom properties below are consumed by Grid, but not defined by Grid. They can be defined via a container or
a custom class name to override grid styling. They will always take precedence over default styles, whether from theme variable
or declared locally. Again, see Theme documentation for guidance on when to use variables from the custom property API.

The grid below is editable. Change the values of CSS variables to their effect on the grid.
