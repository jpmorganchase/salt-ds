# Grid

A Grid presents tabular information that has columns and rows.
Grid is particularly useful if the tabular information is editable or interactive.
Grid provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation, content editing, selection, copy and paste.

Grid is virtualized. Only the visible part is rendered to the DOM.

## Configuring Grid

Use the following call to import Grid.

```
import { Grid } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-grid";
```

### Props

<ArgsTable of={Grid} />

## Grid variants

Grid contains two variants `primary` and `secondary`. If not specified, the default value is `primary`.
Zebra can be enabled for the `primary` variant.

Column separators can be enabled using `columnSeparators` property.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid Variants" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <GridVariantExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Columns

Grid columns can be configured using `GridColumn` component.

Grid package contains the following types of predefined columns:

- RowSelectionCheckboxColumn
- RowSelectionRadioColumn
- NumericColumn

Every one of them renders a `GridColumn` with a specific set of props.
Users can easily create any project-specific column types using the same approach.

#### GridColumn props

<ArgsTable of={GridColumn} />{" "}

### Column groups

Columns can be grouped using the `ColumnGroup` component.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid with grouped columns" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <GridColumnGroupExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Rows

Grid rows are created by providing an array of objects as `rowData` property of the grid.
`rowData` accepts sparse arrays too.
In combination with `onVisibleRowRangeChange` callback this allows lazy loading (server-side data) scenarios.

### Row selection

Grid supports three variants of row selection:

- Single row selection
- Multi-row selection
- None (rows cannot be selected)

`RowSelectionCheckboxColumn` is useful in `multi` row selection mode and `RowSelectionRadioColumn` - in `single` row selection mode.
Both are optional though.

#### Uncontrolled mode

In uncontrolled mode user provides `defaultSelectedRowIdxs` and the grid maintains selection state

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid row selection modes" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <RowSelectionModesExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Controlled mode

In controlled mode user provides `selectedRowIdxs` and updates it when `onRowsSelected` callback is invoked.
Below is an example of two grids with synchronised selections.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid row selection controlled mode" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <ControlledRowSelectionExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Cell selection

In addition to row selection, Grid supports cell range selection using keyboard and mouse.
Cell range selection is controlled by `cellSelectionMode` property.

### Cell customisation

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Cell value customization" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <CellCustomizationExample />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### HTML Anatomy of a Grid

export const Link = ({ children, to, ...props }) => (
  <a {...props} href={to}>
    {children}
  </a>
);

<Canvas>
  <ComponentAnatomy>
    <GridAnatomyExample />
  </ComponentAnatomy>
</Canvas>

### CSS Class

<CSSClassTable of={Grid} />

### Characteristics used

<CharacteristicUsage of={Grid} />

### --uitkGrid CSS custom property API

The default styling values for most Grid attributes are provided by the theme variables. A smaller number of attributes
use hard-coded values local to Grid. Both of these can be overridden, see Theme documentation for detailed usage guidance.

The CSS custom properties below are consumed by Grid, but not defined by Grid. They can be defined via a container or
a custom class name to override button styling. They will always take precedence over default styles, whether from theme variable
or declared locally. Again, see Theme documentation for guidance on when to use variables from the custom property API.

<CSSVariableTable of={Grid} />
