# Toast

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toast--default-info" />
</Canvas>

There are two ways to use Toast:

- To let users know about important information.
- To provide feedback about an error, warning, a successfully completed process or an information update.

The Toast should relate to the current workflow.

## Examples

### Displaying general information

Use the information Toast to draw attention to something your user may be unaware of; for example a link to updated terms and conditions.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toast--default-info" />
</Canvas>

### Letting users know about an issue

If your users have a problem that prevents them from completing a task, such as a system error or technical failure, use the error Toast to tell them how to resolve it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toast--error" />
</Canvas>

Use the warning Toast to let users know about an issue that won't prevent them from continuing the task, but may cause errors if it's not addressed, such as a restriction due to entitlements or current system status.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toast--warning" />
</Canvas>

### When you need to reassure your users

Use the success Toast to reassure your users that an event or process related to the user's current
task has been successfully completed.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toast--success" />
</Canvas>

### Custom content

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toast--custom-content" />
</Canvas>

## Configuring Toast

```
import { Toast } from '@salt-ds/lab';
```
