# Tabs and Tabstrip

There are 4 components that can be combined together to create Tabbed interfaces - `Tabs`, `TabPanel`, `Tab` and `Tabstrip`. The diagram below illustrates the relationship each of these components plays.

The `Tabs` component is the recommended (and easiest) way to employ a tabbed interface in your application. It is a container that encloses the tabbed content items and associates a label with each individual item. A `Tabstrip` will be created automatically, building `Tab` items from the labels. `Tabs` will take care of layout and ensure that the appropriate `aria` attributes are populated to make the components accessible to screen readers.

```jsx
<Tabs
  defaultTabs={["Home", "Transactions", "Loans", "Checks", "Liquidity"]}
  enableAddTab
  enableRenameTab
/>
```

The simplest possible `Tabstrip` can be created by passing an array of string labels to the `Tabstrip` component.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <SaltProvider>
    <Tabstrip
      source={["Home", "Transactions", "Loans", "Checks", "Liquidity"]}
    />
  </SaltProvider>
</Canvas>

However, you will almost certainly never do this, as the resulting code will fail to meet accessibility guidelines. Typically, a `Tabstrip` will be linked to other UI elements on a page and changing the `active` tab will also affect those linked elements. Normally, we will make visible only the element associated with the `active` tab and hide elements associated with remaining tabs. A `Tabstrip` effectively labels a number of alternative views and allows users to switch between those views. In order to make the relationships between these components clear to assistive technology software (screen readers) `id` values are used. Each `Tab` is assigned an `id` value and the target element with which each `Tab` is associated should also carry an `id` value. `aria` attributes are employed to establish a controls/labelled-by relationship between the `Tab` and target element.

The easiest way to create a Tabbed view with all the appropriate `aria` relationships in place, is to use the `Tabs` component with `TabPanel`, rather than create a `Tabstrip` directly.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <SaltProvider>
    <Tabs>
      <TabPanel label="Home">
        <Text>Home Page</Text>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel label="Transactions">
        <Text>Transaction Page</Text>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel label="Loans">
        <Text>Loans Page</Text>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel label="Checks">
        <Text>Checks Page</Text>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel label="Liquidity">
        <Text>Liquidity Page</Text>
      </TabPanel>
    </Tabs>
  </SaltProvider>
</Canvas>

This not only ensures that the correct `aria` attributes are applied, but also takes
care of the display switching between active and non-active `TabPanel` elements.

<br />

Use of the `Tabs` component is recommended, but it isn't always possible. Sometimes the `Tabstrip` and associated elements will be in separate locations on the page. The Tabstrip may be housed within an `AppHeader` or Sidebar or other layout structure. In such cases, it is even more important that the correct `aria` attributes are applied to make the relationships between the various UI elements clear to screen readers. This requires a little more effort than when `Tabs` are employed. The example below illustrates how this can be done.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="lab-tabs--default" />
</Canvas>

By creating `Tab` components, we are able to assign an id value to the `ariaControls` prop. We then assign that same id value to the active `tabpanel`. We can also establish the reverse relationship - the `aria-labelledby` attribute lives on the `tabpanel`. We can assign to this the id of the corresponding `Tab` because the id values of tabs are derived from the id value we pass to the `Tabstrip` itself. In this case, we pass the value 'ts' as the `Tabstrip` id. Our tabs will have default id values of 'ts-0', 'ts-1', 'ts-2' etc.

Tabs are defined either declaratively, by nesting `Tab` elements or via configuration - use of the `tabs` or `defaultTabs` props.

<br />

#### Example 1)

###### (uncontrolled configured tabs)

Simplest possible `Tabstrip`, uncontrolled tab labels are passed as strings

```jsx
<Tabstrip
  defaultTabs={["Home", "Transactions", "Loans", "Checks", "Liquidity"]}
/>
```

<SaltProvider>
  <DefaultTabstrip height={120} />
</SaltProvider>

<br />

#### Example 2) Add and Rename Tabs

###### (uncontrolled configured tabs)

Same uncontrolled `Tabstrip` with two additional attributes

- `enableAddTab` causes the Add Tab button to render
- `enableRenameTab` allows us to rename any tab and encourages us to rename a
  new tab

```jsx
<Tabstrip
  defaultTabs={["Home", "Transactions", "Loans", "Checks", "Liquidity"]}
  enableAddTab
  enableRenameTab
/>
```

<SaltProvider>
  <TabstripUncontrolledStringTabsAddNewWithRename height={120} />
</SaltProvider>

#### Example 3) controlled tabs, with addTab

###### (controlled declarative/dynamic tabs)

Tabs are controlled by caller, so list of tabs must be managed by caller.
Selected Tab must also be managed by caller - if newly added Tab should be
selected, for example, as below. Note: we have not enabled label editing
(`enableRenameTab`) in this example, so labels cannot be changed. Label applied
is under control of caller.

- `enableAddTab` causes the Add Tab button to render new tab

```jsx
const [selectedTabIndex, setSelectedTabIndex] = useTabSelection();
const [tabs, setTabs] = useState(["Home", "Transactions"]);
const tabCount = tabs.length;
const newTabCount = useRef(0);

const handleAddTab = () => {
  newTabCount.current += 1;
  setTabs(
    tabs.concat([
      `New Tab${newTabCount.current > 1 ? " " + newTabCount.current : ""}`,
    ])
  );
  setSelectedTabIndex(tabCount);
};

<Tabstrip enableAddTab onAddTab={handleAddTab} value={selectedTabIndex}>
  {tabs.map((label, i) => (
    <Tab label={label} key={i} />
  ))}{" "}
</Tabstrip>;
```

<SaltProvider>
  <TabstripControlledAddNew height={120} />
</SaltProvider>

#### Example 4) Closeable Tabs

###### (uncontrolled configured tabs)

Same uncontrolled `Tabstrip` with two additional attributes

- `enableAddTab` causes the Add Tab button to render
- `enableRenameTab` allows us to rename any tab and encourages us to rename a
  new tab

```jsx
<Tabstrip
  defaultTabs={["Home", "Transactions", "Loans", "Checks", "Liquidity"]}
  enableAddTab
  enableRenameTab
/>
```

<SaltProvider>
  <TabstripCloseDeclarative height={120} />
</SaltProvider>

#### Example 5) Custom Tab content

###### (declarative/static Tabs)

Simple `Tabstrip` with static content. This format makes it very straightforward
to nest custom content within Tabs, such as the `Link` below.. Because the Tabs
are defined statically, the set of Tabs cannot be changed at runtime, so new
Tabs cannot be added, nor existing Tabs removed. Tab label editing _can_ be
supported using this pattern, but one of the dynamic patterns would make this
easier.

```jsx
<Tabstrip>
  <Tab label="Home" />
  <Tab label="Transactions" />
  <Tab label="Loans" />
  <Tab label="Checks" />
  <Tab>
    <Link href="https://google.com" target="_blank">
      Google
    </Link>
  </Tab>
</Tabstrip>
```

<SaltProvider>
  <TabstripLink height={100} />
</SaltProvider>
