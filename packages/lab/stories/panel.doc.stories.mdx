# Panel

A panel is a way to organize content areas in an application (both web and desktop). It provides expand/collapse behavior, it can have it's own scroll bar, and has "floating" and "docked" states. When a panel is removed from the application window it becomes a child window.

## Panel Component

Panel components have two variants: primary (default) and secondary.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-panel--default" />
</Canvas>
