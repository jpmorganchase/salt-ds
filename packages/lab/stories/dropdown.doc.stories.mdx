# Dropdown

How are the dimensions of a Dropdown calculated

The following props have a bearing on size:

- width (defaults to 180)
- listWidth
  -- fullWidth - className => 100%
  defaults to fullWidth if inFormField

  if fullWidth is set (or if we are in a FormField, in which case fullWidth is the default), We assign fullWidth className to wrapper. We also pass fullWidth to Button, which assigns fullWidth className to Button. width: 100% is assigned via css. No width is set in style

  If width is set. width is set via inline style on Button (triggerControl) . Dropdown root element is inline-block, so width of Button determines width of root element

Width of Popup:

calculate listWidth and pass as width prop to List

If dropdown is fullWidth, this takes precedence, dropdown is measured and that is used as listWidth
OTW, listWidthProp takes precedence, otw width prop (always set becuase 180 default)
