# Dropdown

A Dropdown allows the user to select an item from an array of options displayed in an overlay listâ€“with the selected value displayed in the dropdown field.
Use the Dropdown component when you have a limited list of options (five to ten) that doesn't require filtering to narrow down.

Dropdown contains a Button that opens a List on mouse and keyboard interactions. This button has a chevron icon.

  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--default" />
</Canvas>

### With `defaultSelected` prop

By default the Dropdown is empty on initial render. When the `defaultSelected` prop is passed, Dropdown displays its value.
Use only in uncontrolled Dropdown.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--with-default-selected" />
</Canvas>

### Variants

Dropdown has two variants: `primary` (default) and `secondary`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--variants" />
</Canvas>

Tip: See the [Forms pattern](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/patterns/forms) for guidance on primary vs secondary control selection.

### Readonly

When `readOnly={true}`, users will not be able to interact with Dropdown apart from focusing on it.
Use to indicate that the pre-selected value is valid but changes are not permitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--readonly" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

When `disabled={true}`, user will not be able to interact with Dropdown, it does not receive focus on any interaction.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Controlled

Controlled Dropdown allows states and behaviours to be controlled by the application, not within the component.
It allows for finer control of Dropdown interactions.

You can control the following:

- the opening and closing of Dropdown List (`open`)
- movement up or down of highlighted List items (`highlightedItem`)
- selection of List items (`selected`)

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--controlled" />
</Canvas>

## How to use

### When to use Dropdown

- When you want to allow the user to choose one value from a set of five to ten options and if you want only the selected value to be visible in your UI (e.g., to preserve screen space).

### When not to use Dropdown

- When you have 10+ options and users would benefit from filtering to narrow down the visible options, in this case use [Combo Box](?path=/story/documentation-lab-combo-box-next--docs).
- When you have fewer than five options; and multiple selection is required, in this case use a [Checkbox group](?path=/docs/documentation-core-checkbox--docs).
- When you have fewer than five options; and only single selection is required, use a [Radio Button group](?path=/docs/documentation-core-radio-button--docs).
- If you have a Boolean selection (on/off) consider using a [Switch](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-switch--docs).

## Accessibility

The Dropdown control must be wrapped in a [Form Field](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/documentation-core-form-field--docs) control to be compliant with WCAG 2.1 standards.

The Form Field provides a visible label and help and status information.
