# Dropdown

A Dropdown allows the user to select an item from an array of options displayed in an overlay list–with the selected value displayed in the dropdown field.
Use the Dropdown component when you have a limited list of options (5-10) that don’t require filtering to narrow down.

Dropdown contains a Button with a chevron Icon, that opens a List on mouse and keyboard interactions.

  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--default" />
</Canvas>

### With `defaultSelected` prop

When `defaultSelected` prop is passed, Dropdown displays its value on initial render, otherwise it’s empty by default.
Use only in uncontrolled Dropdown.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--with-default-selected" />
</Canvas>

### Variants

Dropdown has two variants: `primary` (default) and `secondary`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--variants" />
</Canvas>

Tip: See the [Forms pattern](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/patterns/forms) for guidance on primary vs secondary control selection.

### Readonly

When `readOnly={true}`, user will not be able to interact with Dropdown apart from focusing on it.
Use when you would like the user to know that the pre-selected value is valid but changes are not permitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--readonly" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

When `disabled={true}`, user will not be able to interact with Dropdown, it does not receive focus on any interaction.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Controlled

Controlled Dropdown allows states and behaviours to be controlled by the application, not within the component.
It allows for finer control of Dropdown interactions.

User may control:

- the opening and closing of Dropdown List (`open`)
- movement up or down of highlighted List items (`highlightedItem`)
- selection of List items (`selectedItem`)

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--controlled" />
</Canvas>

## How to use

### When to use Dropdown

- When you want to allow the user to choose 1 value from a set of 5-10 options and if you only want the selected value to be visible in your UI (e.g., to preserve screen space).

### When not to use Dropdown

- When you have 10+ options and users would benefit from filtering to narrow down the visible options, use [Combo Box]().
- When you have less than 5 options, and multiple selection is enabled, use a [Checkbox group](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/documentation-core-checkbox--page).
- When you have less than 5 options, and single selection only, use a [Radio Button group](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/documentation-core-radio-button--page).
- If you have a Boolean selection (on/off) consider using a [Switch](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/documentation-lab-switch--page).

## Accessibility

The Dropdown control must be wrapped in a [Form Field](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/documentation-core-form-field--page) control to be compliant with WCAG 2.1 standards.

The Form Field provides a visible label and help and status information.
