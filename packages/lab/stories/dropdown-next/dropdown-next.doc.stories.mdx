# Dropdown Next

A Dropdown allows the user to select an item from an array of options displayed in a list overlay – with the selected value displayed in the dropdown field.

Use the Dropdown component when you have a list of options that don’t require filtering, and you want to display all available options alongside the current selection.

To enable filtering, use Combobox component.

Dropdown contains a Button with a chevron Icon, that opens a List on mouse and keyboard interactions.
When `defaultSelected` prop is passed, Dropdown displays its value on initial render, otherwise it’s empty by default.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--default" />
</Canvas>

### Secondary

Dropdown when variant is set to `secondary`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--secondary" />
</Canvas>

### Readonly

When ` readOnly={true}`, user will not be able to interact with Dropdown, it does not receive focus on any interaction.
Use when you would like the user to know that the pre-selected value is valid but changes are not permitted.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--readonly" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

When `disabled={true}`, user will not be able to interact with Dropdown, it does not receive focus on any interaction.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Controlled

Controlled Dropdown allows states and behaviours to be controlled by the application, not within the component.
It allows for finer control of Dropdown interactions.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-dropdown-next--controlled" />
</Canvas>

## How to use

### When to use Dropdown

- When you want to allow user to choose 1 value from a set of options
- When you want user to see only the selected value when Dropdown is inactive
