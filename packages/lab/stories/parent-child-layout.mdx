# Parent Child Layout

Displays a hierarchical structure comprising of a main content area and an accompanying parent region, used to drive the content that is displayed.
The parent and child layout is built using [Flex layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flex-layout--page) and it is intended for displaying two related layers such as navigation and associated content or a preferences dialog.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ParentChildLayoutStories.Default} />
</Canvas>

## Use Parent Child Layout when...

You want your layout to be split into two regions in a responsive manner.

### Don't use Parent Child Layout when...

You want your layout to flow in a single dimension. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Stack layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-stack-layout--page), [Flow layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flow-layout--page) or [Flex layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flex-layout--page).

### Examples

#### Stacked

The parent and child component changes to a stacked view once it approaches a specified breakpoint that can be customized via the `stackedAtBreakpoint` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ParentChildLayoutStories.SaltStacked} />
</Canvas>

#### Reduced motion

You can customize or disable the animations using the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media feature.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ParentChildLayoutStories.SaltReducedMotion} />
</Canvas>

#### Composite usage

This example shows a number of Salt components being used in conjunction with Parent Child Layout to build a responsive page.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ParentChildLayoutStories.Composite} />
</Canvas>
