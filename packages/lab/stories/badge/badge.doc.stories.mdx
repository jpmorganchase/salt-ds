# Badge

Badge is an alpha or numeric character annotation indicating the number of outstanding items. It appears on the top-right of an element, usually an icon. 

## Icon Badge

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--icon" />
</Canvas>

## Words Badge

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--words" />
</Canvas>

## Badge with maximum number

Specify the maximum number to be displayed with `max`. If `value` exceeds `max`, suffix `+` will be appended.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--max-number" />
</Canvas>

## Badge with string

`value` can accept both number and string

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--string" />
</Canvas>

## Badge with truncated string

When a string of greater than 4 characters is passed to `value` it is truncated and appended with `...`

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--truncated" />
</Canvas>

# Content

If a numeric annotation exceeds the max value passed as a prop, a plus (+) sign will be displayed after the max value stated. In the case that no max value is passed to the component, the value will truncate after 3 digits and therefore display 999+ for any values over 999.  

If an alpha or text annotation in Badge exceeds four characters an ellipsis is used to truncate the annotation after the fourth character. 

# When not to use Component Name 

Badge must not indicate status through colour, such as red-amber-green or progress.

Donâ€™t allow users to edit the contents of Badge. To accept user input, consider using an interactive Pill. 

# Accessibility 

If custom colours are used, consider the minimum contrast guidance outlined in WCAG 2.1 documentation. The document recommends that the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.  

We recommend only using the accent colour for Bbadge. But for overrides, ADA should be considered where possible.
