# Badge

A Badge is a numeric annotation that indicates the number of outstanding items that need to be addressed. It appears on the top-right of an element, usually an icon. The badge can accommodate values of up to four digits in length.

## Icon Badge

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--icon" />
</Canvas>

## Words Badge

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--words" />

## Badge with maximum number

Specify the maximum number to be displayed with `max`. If `value` exceeds `max`, suffix `+` will be appended.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--max-number" />
</Canvas>

## Badge with string

`value` can accept both number and string

<Canvas>

## Badge with truncated string

When a string of greater than 4 characters is passed to `value` it is truncated and appended with `...`
