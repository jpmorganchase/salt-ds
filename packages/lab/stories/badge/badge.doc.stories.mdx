# Badge

A Badge is a numeric annotation that indicates the number of outstanding items that need to be addressed. It can appear in the top right of an element (usually an icon) or inline next to an element.
For numerical characters the badge will truncate after 3 digits. For strings there is no inbuilt truncation but it is advised to not exceed 4 characters.
Badge is used to reflect a change of state and should therefore be used in conjunction with integrative components e.g Button and List

## Icon Badge

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--icon" />
</Canvas>

Specify the maximum number to be displayed with `max`. If `value` exceeds `max`, suffix `+` will be appended.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--max-number" />
</Canvas>

## Badge with string

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--string" />
</Canvas>

## Badge Inline

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-badge--list-story" />
</Canvas>

# Content

If a numeric annotation exceeds the max value passed as a prop, a plus (+) sign will be displayed after the max value stated. In the case that no max value is passed to the component, the value will truncate after 3 digits and therefore display 999+ for any values over 999.

For string characters it is advised to not exceed 4 characters.

# When not to use Badge

Badge must not indicate status through colour, such as red-amber-green or progress.

# Accessibility

If custom colours are used, consider the minimum contrast guidance outlined in WCAG 2.1 documentation. The document recommends that the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

We recommend only using the accent colour for Badge. But for overrides, accessibility should be considered where possible.
