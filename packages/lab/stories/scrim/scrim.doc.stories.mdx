# Scrim

A Scrim is a temporary, semi-transparent layer that makes underlying content less prominent.

As a backdrop, it brings an overlaying component—such as as [Dialog](/docs/lab-dialog--basic-dialog) to the forefront of the user interface, drawing attention to this content.

## Usage

Use a Scrim to focus the user’s attention on the content of an overlaying component within a specific viewport or content area. Place it in an application window, widget, data visualization or panel, such as a [Dialog](/docs/lab-dialog--basic-dialog).

**Best practice**
Don’t use a Scrim if the user needs to interact with the content beneath the overlaying component at the same time, for example, in a master detail layout.

## Interactions and behaviors

**Modal experience**
The Scrim provides a modal experience by obscuring the underlying content.
