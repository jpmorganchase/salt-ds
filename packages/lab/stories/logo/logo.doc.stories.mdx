# Logo

Logos are image/s, text/s or a combination of the two that depict the name and purpose of a business.

Logo component gives users the flexibility of including the elements they need to meet their design specs. It can contain elements like SVG, LogoImage, LogoSeparator and [Text component](?path=/docs/documentation-core-text--docs) or other elements like SVG image.

The Logo component makes it easy to include a brand-compliant logo for a J.P. Morgan or Chase division in your application. It can also support an application title.

## Usage

Use the Logo component whenever you need to visually reference one of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. brands within your application. It is compliant with brand guidelines and accommodates a supporting application title.

### Positioning

Always place the logo on the top left corner of the application. It should never be centered.

### Additional features

The Logo component can be used to provide a link e.g., to a Homepage. Simply wrap the component in a [Link](?path=/story/documentation-core-link--docs) component and specify the destination.

### Best practices

Never embed the brand logo into body copy. Instead spell out the name, e.g., “J.P. Morgan”, in text.

Refer to the [J.P. Morgan Brand Toolbox](https://www.jpmcbrandtoolbox.com/) to check that your logo usage follows brand guidelines.
