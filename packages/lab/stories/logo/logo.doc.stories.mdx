# Logo

Logos are image/s, text/s or a combination of the two that depict the name and purpose of a business.

Making Logo compositional means that it gives users the flexibility of including the elements they need to meet their design specs.
Logo is essentially a wrapping component for LogoImage, LogoSeparator, [Text component](?path=/docs/documentation-core-text--page) or other elements like SVG image.

## Examples

### Logo containing a LogoImage

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-logo--logo-with-image" />
</Canvas>

### Logo containing a LogoImage and Text

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-logo--image-and-text" />
</Canvas>

### Logo containing a LogoImage, Text and LogoSeparator

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-logo--image-and-text-with-separator" />
</Canvas>

### Link wrapping Logo

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-logo--link-logo" />
</Canvas>

### Link wrapping LogoImage only

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-logo--link-on-image" />
