# Switch

A Switch is a control that behaves like a checkbox but should only be used if the value is of type boolean and the action will have immediate impact. The switch value should be applied right after the `onChange` event and not on a form submission. Controls which toggle boolean values within a form should use the Checkbox component.

## Basic Switch Component

By default the Switch will handle the checkbox state automatically. The value can be set using the defaultChecked prop. The checked prop should only be used if you want a controlled Switch that requires some logic for validating value. The `onChange` event can be used to read the value using the second parameter.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-switch--feature-switch" />
</Canvas>

## Checked

Using the prop `defaultChecked` a Switch can be set to checked but still be used as an uncontrolled component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-switch--checked" />
</Canvas>

## Controlled

A controlled Switch will rely on the application to manually set the value through the checked prop. The onChange event should be used to read the value and decide what the next value should be. This value is updated by changing the checked prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-switch--controlled" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

Disabled Switches can be either true or false but cannot be changed. Disabled Switches have a 0.4 opacity applied to indicate the restricted state.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-switch--disabled" />
</Canvas>
