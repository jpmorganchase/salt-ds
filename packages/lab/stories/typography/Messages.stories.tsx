            maxRows=2. A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire
            soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my
            whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this
            spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so
            happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere
            tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable
            of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel
            that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely
            valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the
            upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few
            stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down
            among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to
            the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear
            the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar
            with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies,
            then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own
            image, and the breath
