# Tokenized Input Next

Tokenized Input Next provides an input field for text that’s converted into a pill within the field, or tokenized, when the user enters a delimiting character.

The component accepts free-form text and can create an unlimited number of pills.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-tokenized-input-next--default" />
</Canvas>

## Examples

### Default

The default component has no text input constraints, so you can use it to accept any alphanumeric character or symbol. When the user enters a text value followed by a delimiter, the value is tokenized into a pill.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-tokenized-input-next--default" />
</Canvas>

### Controlled

With the controlled mode, the logic of Tokenized Input Next is determined by the application and not internally, within the component. It provides developers finer-grained control of both the input value and selected items.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-tokenized-input-next--controlled" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

You can disable the Tokenized Input Next if required, e.g., due to context or user permissions.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-tokenized-input-next--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### With Validation

If required, you can configure custom acceptance criteria. When the text value entered by the user doesn’t meet your criteria, it won’t be tokenized.

In this example, we’ve configured the component to reject duplicated values.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-tokenized-input-next--with-validation" />
</Canvas>

### With Customized Delimiter

By default, the component tokenizes preceding text into a pill when Enter, Tab or the comma (,) key is actioned by the user.
You can customize the key or character that separates and delimits text to fit the expected convention within your application. For example, you may choose to define a semi-colon (;) or full-stop (.) as your delimiter.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-tokenized-input-next--with-customized-delimiter" />
</Canvas>

## How to use

Always wrap Tokenized Input Next in a Form Field component to ensure ADA compliance—and never use it independently. The Form Field provides a label, activation line, background fill, help text and various states.

### When to use Tokenized Input Next

Tokenized Input Next is typically used within the context of a form. It’s ideal when you have a field that can contain multiple, specific values related to a single topic or context—and these values can be removed quickly and in their entirety. You would use the component, for example, in a field for email addresses or a fast field for a cash ticket.

### When not to use Tokenized Input Next

- Never use Tokenized Input Next as a standalone component; it will fail to meet ADA requirements.
- Consider the Combo Box component if you need to generate a list of suggested values that partially match the text entered by the user.
- Use a Combo Box when your selection is constrained to options in an existing dataset.

### Accessibility

To be considered accessible within a form, the Tokenized Input Next _must_ be wrapped in a [Form Field](?path=/docs/documentation-core-form-field--docs) component, which will provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback.
