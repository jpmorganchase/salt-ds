# Toggle Button Group

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toggle-button-group--horizontal" />
</Canvas>

The Toggle Button Group allows users to make a mutually exclusive selection from a set of related commands—with only one option selected at a time.

## Examples

### Text and Icon

Use icons and text in Toggle Buttons if it's important to visually reinforce the theme of the options or if providing additional context may help decision-making (for examples, selecting a document type or a text style).

- Pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to the icon so its label is not announced by the screen reader.
- To reduce visual noise and mitigate alignment issues, use icons in Toggle Button labels consistently across all options in the group.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toggle-button-group--horizontal" />
</Canvas>

### Icon only

The Toggle Button Group can be used with icons only.

- An accessible label should be provided for each button.
- A `Tooltip` should be used to provide additional context for each `ToggleButton`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toggle-button-group--horizontal-icon-only" />
</Canvas>

### Text only

You can configure the Toggle Buttons to display text only when you can't identify a suitable or intuitive icon.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toggle-button-group--horizontal-text-only" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Disable the entire group, if required by context or users permissions.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toggle-button-group--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Orientation

The Toggle Button Group can be vertically orientated using the `orientation` prop, if the options are better presented in a stacked layout.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toggle-button-group--vertical" />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toggle-button-group--vertical-icon-only" />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-toggle-button-group--vertical-text-only" />
</Canvas>

## How to use

### When to use Toggle Button Group

- Use the Toggle Button to present users with a mutually exclusive selection within a Toggle Button Group - users can select only one option.
- When displaying two or more options, which are related by function or context (for example, text alignment—left, center, right; speed selection—slow, medium, fast).

### When not to use Toggle Button Group

- If the options in the group are not deemed high priority and high emphasis is not required, consider using a [Radio Button Group](/components/radio-button-group).
- If all options in the group don't need to be visible at once, consider using a Dropdown component for making selections.
- If you present options in a Toggle Button Group within a compact UI, or they're subject to change depending on context, consider using a Selectable Pill instead.
