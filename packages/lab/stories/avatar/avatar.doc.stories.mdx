# Avatar

An Avatar is a small circular graphical representation of a user entity through a profile picture or name initials.
It has three variants to account for different types of data:

- `Image` is used when a photo is available;
- `Initials` is used when a photo is unavailable but profile information is;
- A default `Icon` is used when neither photo nor profile information are available.

### Features

#### Default Avatar

Each Avatar variant has a default size across all four densities, equal to the size foundation size-base; 20px (HD), 28px (MD), 36px (LD), and 44px (TD)
The size of Avatar can be changed in multiples of the base size.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-avatar--default" />
</Canvas>

Avatar renders with a default icon defined by `UserIcon` but an alternative icon can be passed as `fallbackIcon`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-avatar--alternative-icon" />
</Canvas>

#### Image

Reference your image source in the `src` prop, or pass it as the child of the component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-avatar--with-image" />
</Canvas>

#### Initials

You can pass the user's initials as the child of the component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-avatar--initials" />
</Canvas>

#### Custom image or SVG

You can pass a custom image or SVG as the child of the component to be used as an image.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-avatar--with-custom-svg" />
</Canvas>

Note that for images passed as children, you will also need to handle the fallback logic.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-avatar--image-fallback" />
</Canvas>

#### Alternative Background

The `Avatar` background can be customized by using `--saltAvatar-background`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-avatar--alternative-background" />
</Canvas>
