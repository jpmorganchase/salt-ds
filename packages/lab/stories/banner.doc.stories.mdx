# Banner

The Banner component lets your users know about an err, warning, a successfully completed or an information update. The banner should relate to the current workflow
and span the page or container horizontally to give quick and non-disruptive feedback.


# When to use Banner features

## When you need to display general information

you should use the information Banner to draw attention to inform your user was unaware of.

<Canvas>
    <Banner
      //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
      LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
    >
      Banners appear inline on the page
    </Banner>
</Canvas>

## When you need to let users know about an issue

If your users have a problem that prevents them from completing a task, such as a system error 
or technical failure, the error Banner will guide them to the right action to resolve it.

<Canvas>
    <Banner
      //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
      LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
      state="error"
    >
      There has been an update to the terms and conditions
    </Banner>
</Canvas>

You should use the warning Banner to let users know about an issue that won't prevent them from
continuing the task, but may cause errors if it's not addressed, such as a restriction due to entitlements
or current system status.

<Canvas>
    <Banner
      //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
      LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
      state="warning"
    >
      Action failed
    </Banner>
</Canvas>

## When you need to reassure your users

You should use the success Banner to reassure your users that an event or process related to the user's current
task has been successfully completed.

<Canvas>
    <Banner
      //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
      LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
      state="success"
    >
      Database updated
    </Banner>
</Canvas>


# Emphasis

Banner has two emphasis levels, medium and high. The high emphasis banner uses a background color that is matches the
state for further emphasis on the banner message.

<Canvas>
    <Banner
      //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
      LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
      emphasis="high"
      state="success"
    >
      Database updated
    </Banner>
</Canvas>

# Accessibility

Banner is accessible by assistive technologies like screen readers, and provides full WAI-ARIA support.

By default, Banner's content is spoken by screen readers. If you want screen readers to read the
surrounding page content instead, we recommend you turn this feature off with the `disableAnnouncer`
prop.
