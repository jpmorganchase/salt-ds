# Banner

The Banner component lets your users know about an error, warning, a successfully completed or an information update. The banner should relate to the current workflow
and span the page or container horizontally to give quick and non-disruptive feedback.

## How you can use Banner

The Banner itself is only a presentational component, it does not provide the logic for deciding whether to render
or not. You will need to provide state management for deciding when to render a Banner.

You should always position the Banner component in the main content area, directly below
the navigation or in the related container component.

<Canvas>
  <Banner>Banners appear inline on the page</Banner>
</Canvas>

If you need to share multiple notifications of the same state with your users, you should summarize them in a single Banner

If you have multiple notifications of different states, you should stack the respective banners from top to bottom,
int the following order: Information, Error, Warning, Success.

## Banner States

Banner contains four states `info`, `warning`, `error` and `success`. If not specified, the default value is `info`.

<Canvas>
  <StackLayout gap={2}>
    <Banner>Banners appear inline on the page</Banner>
    <Banner state="warning">Banners appear inline on the page</Banner>
    <Banner state="error">Banners appear inline on the page</Banner>
    <Banner state="success">Banners appear inline on the page</Banner>
  </StackLayout>
</Canvas>

## Emphasis variants

Banner has two emphasis levels; medium (default) and high.

<Canvas>
  <StackLayout gap={2}>
    <Banner emphasis="high">High emphasis</Banner>
    <Banner emphasis="high" state="warning">
      High emphasis
    </Banner>
    <Banner emphasis="high" state="error">
      High emphasis
    </Banner>
    <Banner emphasis="high" state="success">
      High emphasis
    </Banner>
  </StackLayout>
</Canvas>

## Dismissible

By default, the Banner is non-dismissible, If you want to make the Banner dismissible, then you should provide a function
to the onClose prop.

<Canvas>
  <Banner
    onClose={() => {
      console.log("Dismissed");
    }}
  >
    Dismissible
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

You should configure Banner to close when:

- The user performs an action that fixes an issue, for example they correct a validation error.
- The system status that triggered the notification is resolved, for example, a server connection is restored

## Link

A Banner can render a Link to take the user to the relevant part of the application. The link should
guide the user to part of the application that requires action.

<Canvas>
  <Banner
    //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
    LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
  >
    There has been an update to the terms and conditions
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

## Render

Banner uses the render props pattern to enable you to customize the rendered content.

The render callback can be configured either by providing a function the `children` property
or an explicit method using the `render` property.

The render callback has the following props:

- getIcon function callback that returns the default icon for the current state with the default Icon Props
- getIconProps function callback that returns the icon props to apply on a custom icon
- getLabelProps function callback that returns the label props
- getLinkProps function callback that returns the link props

<Canvas>
  <Banner
    render={({ Icon, getIconProps, getLabelProps, getLinkProps }) => (
      <>
        <Icon {...getIconProps()} aria-label={"Success"} />
        <span {...getLabelProps()}>
          Example custom renderer
          <Link {...getLinkProps()}>custom example link</Link>
        </span>
      </>
    )}
    state="success"
    {...props}
  />
</Canvas>

## When to use Banner features

### Displaying general information

You should use the information Banner to draw attention to inform your user was unaware of, for example a link to updated terms and conditions.

<Canvas>
  <Banner
    //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
    LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
  >
    There has been an update to the terms and conditions
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

### Letting users know about an issue

If your users have a problem that prevents them from completing a task, such as a system error
or technical failure, the error Banner will guide them to the right action to resolve it.

<Canvas>
  <Banner
    //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
    LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
    state="error"
  >
    Action failed
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

You should use the warning Banner to let users know about an issue that won't prevent them from
continuing the task, but may cause errors if it's not addressed, such as a restriction due to entitlements
or current system status.

<Canvas>
  <Banner
    //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
    LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
    state="warning"
  >
    System is under increased load
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

### Reassuring your users

You should use the success Banner to reassure your users that an event or process related to the user's current
task has been successfully completed.

<Canvas>
  <Banner
    //eslint-disable-next-line no-script-url
    LinkProps={{ href: "javascript:void(0)" }}
    state="success"
  >
    Database updated
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Banner is accessible by assistive technologies like screen readers, and provides full WAI-ARIA support.

By default, Banner's content is spoken by screen readers. If you want screen readers to read the
surrounding page content instead, we recommend you turn this feature off with the `disableAnnouncer`
prop.

The following keyboard interaction applies to the Banner component:

| Key                                  | Function                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> | If focus is on the "X" button, activates the button and closes the Banner |
