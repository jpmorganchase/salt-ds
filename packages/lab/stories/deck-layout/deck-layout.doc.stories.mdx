# Deck Layout

The Deck Layout defines pages of content that appear within the same specified region, one at a time.

It allows motion customization (`slide` or `fade`) and a custom direction for the animations (`horizontal` or `vertical`).

This layout component also allows you to assign the initial page to be rendered via the `activeIndex` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-layout-deck-layout--default" />
</Canvas>

## Use Deck Layout when...

You need to display a collection of children (pages). You may also choose to control the movement between pages by using buttons or tabs.

### Don't use Deck Layout when...

Instead you want your content to be displayed in a layer above the existing page. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Layer Layout](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-layout-layer-layout--docs).

### Example

#### Deck used with tabstrip

This example shows how the Deck Layout can be used in conjunction with `Tabstrip`. You can enable animations by setting the `animation` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-layout-deck-layout--deck-in-tabstrip" />
</Canvas>
