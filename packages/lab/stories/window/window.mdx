# Window Style injection

The window component is an abstraction layer created to allow developers
using desktop platforms to inject their own "window" components for use
in components that are rendered to their own layer such as the Dialog and
Tooltip.

One of the key issues with the window abstraction is the use of style injection.
This depends on how the window abstraction is carried out, if the portal opened,
is itself a React application, then that application will handle styling in the
window. If the window's content is being written to by React's Portal API then style injection
will be required to add the CSS to the opened window's document.

## Copying styles to the child window

One method of style injection would be to copy over the styles present in the parent window,
This would ensure that all component styles loaded in the parent window are loaded into the
child window. Those styles can be optimised by querying the children of the window
via ReactDOMServer to figure out which styles to add.

This method of optimising will not work for child components that are rendered later such
as the OverflowMenu, where the component is rendered into the child window following a measurement
after the initial render. The dependency of ReactDOMServer also produces multiple warning messages
regarding useLayoutEffect having no effect on server side rendering.

Without any optimising, this method works because all the component's CSS is injected into the
main application window, even if it is not being rendered initially.

```ts
document.head.querySelectorAll("style").forEach((htmlElement) => {
  console.log(htmlElement);
  (win as Window).document.head.appendChild(htmlElement.cloneNode(true));
});
```

## Delegating style injection to the components

Another method style injection is to delegate responsibility of style injection to the components
themselves. This process is normally carried out by webpack or rollup, both use the global document
object to append the styles. This method will not work with external windows that are rendered to by the React portal API. This
is due to how the styles are inserted into the document.

One way of overcoming the issue of injecting the style into the correct document is to use context
to pass the document to the salt components. The components will then inject the style into the
given document.

```ts
// context sensitive document object using React's context API
export interface DocumentContextProps {
  currentDocument?: Document;
}

// default value is undefined so that injection does not happen on the root window
// Injection on the main window can be enable by using document as the default
export const DocumentContext = createContext<DocumentContextProps>({
  currentDocument: undefined,
});

export function useCurrentDocument(): Document | undefined {
  const { currentDocument } = useContext(DocumentContext);
  return currentDocument;
}
```

```ts
// useStyleInsertionEffect is a wrapper around useInsertionEffect if using React 18
// which falls back to useLayoutEffect in React 17 and below

const documentToApplyStyleTo = useCurrentDocument();
useStyleInsertionEffect(() => {
  injectStyleIntoGivenDocument(style, documentToApplyStyleTo);
}, []);
```

This technique works for components that are completely enclosed within the context such as the
example below.

```tsx
<Portal>
  <Window id={"example"}>
    <Button />
  </Window>
</Portal>
```

Components that import a style, render a window, but are not encased in a SaltProvider such as Tooltip
won't work properly because they themselves render a window while importing their own CSS. The CSS would
be injected into the parent document context instead of the components own window.

```tsx
// Tooltip.tsx

// Attempting to get the context from this scope will result in the parent document context
// being fetched instead of the context within the window

const Window = useWindow();

return (
  <Portal disablePortal={disablePortal} container={container}>
    {open && (
      <Window
        className={clsx(withBaseName(), withBaseName(state))}
        ref={ref}
        {...rest}
      >
        <div className={withBaseName("content")}>
          {render ? (
            render({
              Icon: (passedProps: IconProps) => getIcon(passedProps),
              getIconProps: () => defaultIconProps,
            })
          ) : (
            <>
              {getIcon({})}
              <span className={withBaseName("body")}>{title}</span>
            </>
          )}
        </div>
        {!hideArrow && (
          <div className={withBaseName("arrow")} {...arrowProps} />
        )}
      </Window>
    )}
  </Portal>
);
```

It would be impractical to refactor components like Tooltip into subcomponents just to make them suitable for style injection. One solution to this
problem is to create a functional component to inject the style into the window. It

```tsx
export const StyleInsertion = ({ style }: { style: string }): null => {
  const documentToApplyStyleTo = useCurrentDocument();
  useLayoutEffectOnce(
    true,
    () => {
      injectStyleIntoGivenDocument(style, documentToApplyStyleTo);
    },
    []
  );

  return null;
};
```

```tsx
import style from "./Tooltip.css";

// Tooltip.tsx

const Window = useWindow();

return (
  <Portal disablePortal={disablePortal} container={container}>
    {open && (
      <Window
        className={clsx(withBaseName(), withBaseName(state))}
        ref={ref}
        {...rest}
      >
        <StyleInsertion style={style} />
        <div className={withBaseName("content")}>
          {render ? (
            render({
              Icon: (passedProps: IconProps) => getIcon(passedProps),
              getIconProps: () => defaultIconProps,
            })
          ) : (
            <>
              {getIcon({})}
              <span className={withBaseName("body")}>{title}</span>
            </>
          )}
        </div>
        {!hideArrow && (
          <div className={withBaseName("arrow")} {...arrowProps} />
        )}
      </Window>
    )}
  </Portal>
);
```

Another solution would be to add an optional prop to the window abstraction that allows
CSS to be passed down and injected into that window's document object. This would also
overcome the issue of injecting the styles into the window. This bespoke prop would only
serve that one purpose.

```tsx
import style from "./Tooltip.css";

// Tooltip.tsx

const Window = useWindow();

return (
  <Portal disablePortal={disablePortal} container={container}>
    {open && (
      <Window
        className={clsx(withBaseName(), withBaseName(state))}
        ref={ref}
        cssInject={style}
        {...rest}
      >
        <div className={withBaseName("content")}>
          {render ? (
            render({
              Icon: (passedProps: IconProps) => getIcon(passedProps),
              getIconProps: () => defaultIconProps,
            })
          ) : (
            <>
              {getIcon({})}
              <span className={withBaseName("body")}>{title}</span>
            </>
          )}
        </div>
        {!hideArrow && (
          <div className={withBaseName("arrow")} {...arrowProps} />
        )}
      </Window>
    )}
  </Portal>
);
```

Delegating the responsibility of style injection to the components would require each component to call
the `injectStyleIntoGivenDocument` function. Developers of Salt will have to remember to do this.
One could draw parallels to MUI's styled components API which requires users to used the `styled` function
and pass in their components. The function returns a styled component.

### Theme insertion

Theme insertion could be handled by using a form of selectively copying styles. Themes have an id and name that could
be used to get the style tags containing the theme CSS. The theme can be fetched using the salt Provider and theme context.
It would not account for any extra global CSS that a user would import at the top level of their application that is not
part of their theme. This would also require app developers to mark their theme with a dataID attribute, so the theme
insertion code can search for the style tags and insert them.

```ts
const themes = useTheme();

const themeIDs = new Set<string>();

for (const theme of themes) {
  themeIDs.add(theme.id);
}

// The query selector could use these ids to filter out the style tags with the theme ids
```

Context can also be used to pass the CSS string to the window which would also require manual work from developers.
Global CSS is normally imported without using a default export. Copying all loaded styles to the window would keep
the responsibility of injecting the theme within the toolkit rather than delegating it to the app developer.
