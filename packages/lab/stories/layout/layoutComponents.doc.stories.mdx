# Layout Components

Layout componentry was created to help you build consistent and responsive layouts while using Toolkit components.

## Border Layout

Defines the main content regions of an application, region or widget, such as a footer, header or side navigation.

The region is defined by the `position` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Border Layout">{ToolkitBorderLayout.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

## API

```
import {BorderLayout, BorderItem} from "@jpmuitk/toolkit-odyssey";
```

## Props

<br />

### Border Layout

<ArgsTable story="Border Layout" />

### Border Item

<ArgsTable of={BorderItem} />

## Grid Layout

Defines an equally distributed layout system using columns and rows.

It defaults to a twelve column grid but you can customise it using the `columns` and `rows` props.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Grid Layout">{ToolkitGridLayout.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

## API

```
import {GridLayout, GridItem} from "@jpmuitk/toolkit-odyssey";
```

## Props

<br />

### Grid Layout

<ArgsTable story="Grid Layout" />

### Grid Item

<ArgsTable of={GridItem} />

## Styling layout components

You can override a default style assignment in layout components, however, in some cases the styles are dynamically defined by JS values and overriding the CSS variable will not work.
