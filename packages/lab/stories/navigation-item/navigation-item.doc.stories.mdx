# Navigation Item

Navigation Item allows users to navigate between distinct applications and website pages.

When the Navigation Item is not a parent, it contains a link, which users can click, and which receives focus via a keyboard interaction. When the Navigation Item is a parent, it will contain an expandable action, which contains a button instead.

A Navigation Item hugs its content by default, but is customisable so that its container can be adjusted to fit any preferred width.

##### Use when

- Use Navigation Item when you have multiple levels of navigation in your application or website.

- We suggest first considering a horizontal group of Navigation Items for distinct webpages or applications. If you have multiple (more than 8) services to navigate to at a platform level, or have navigation across distinct apps, consider using a vertical group instead.

- Our recommendation is to display Navigation Items in a fixed App Header (or header area) if you need your items to remain visible on scroll.

##### Don't use when

- When you need to show different views of content within the same page, consider using [Tabs](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-tabs--page) instead.

- When your content is very specific ,in this case, a minimalistic or single-page design may be more appropriate than a complex navigation structure. Consider using the [Interactable Card](?path=/docs/documentation-core-card--page), or a [Link](?path=/docs/documentation-core-link--page) component within the body of the page.

## Content

- Our recommendation is that all labels should be short and concise.

- Always use labels in sentence case in a Navigation Item.

- When using a [Badge](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-badge--page) component within a Navigation Item, we recommend using sentence case.

- In a Horizontal Navigation Item, do not wrap labels, use truncation with [Tooltip](<(?path=/docs/documentation-core-tooltip--page)>) if necessary.

- In a Vertical Navigation Item, labels can wrap onto multiple lines if necessary, and is preferred over truncation.

## Features

### Horizontal (default)

The default configuration of the Navigation Item comes in a horizontal orientation.

  <Story id="lab-navigation-item--default" />
</Canvas>

### Vertical

The orientation of the default Navigation Item can be changed by passing a vertical orientation prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-navigation-item--vertical" />
</Canvas>

### With icon

An icon can effectively signify the Navigation Item’s purpose, whether it’s related to a product's identity, a specific tool, function, or a configuration setting.

**Tip** Ensure that icon descriptors are used consistently across all items within the same hierarchy level. This keeps the parent-child relationships clear and maintains the navigation hierarchy.

</Canvas>

### With Badge

Navigation Items can feature a [Badge](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-badge--page) that serves as a visual cue. They can inform users of additional context, notifications, signpost new content or indicate a status.

**Note**: A badge should only be placed in a Navigation Item that does not nest, i.e. it will not have a chevron.

</Canvas>

### With nested items

Navigation Items that feature a chevron indicate that they are a parent item which nest additional navigation items inside it.

  <Story id="lab-navigation-item--with-nested-items" />
</Canvas>

### Horizontal group

Use horizontal Navigation Items within a horizontal group to establish a consistent and easily accessible pathway for users, while conserving valuable screen estate. Users will be able to easily scan and identify navigation options in a seamless user experience.

**Tip** Use a horizontal group of Navigation Items when you have less than 8 items, otherwise consider a vertical group of items.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-navigation-item--horizontal-group" />
</Canvas>

### Vertical group

A vertical navigation group provides a simple, single-level list of links that users can select within an application or website.

**Note**: Use a vertical Navigation Item in a vertical orientation, with a descriptive [Icon](?path=/docs/documentation-icons-icon--page) and a [Badge](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-badge--page) when providing the user with a quick and informative way to assess the relevance or significance of a Navigation Item, aiding their decision-making process and overall navigation experience.

**Tip** Use a vertical group of Navigation Items when you have more than 8 items, otherwise, consider a horizontal group of items.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-navigation-item--vertical-group" />
</Canvas>

### Vertical group nested

Use vertical navigation when handling a hierarchical structure of nested pages. This configuration allows users to reveal nested items when selecting a parent item, facilitating an intuitive exploration of the content hierarchy.

When a vertical nested group is collapsed, and there is an active nested item within it, the parent item will obtain a blur-selected state.

**Note**: If a Navigation Item has nested items within it, it will act as a trigger to show and hide the nested items. A parent item cannot act as a link and navigate to an overview page. If you require an overview page, use the first nested item to achieve this.
