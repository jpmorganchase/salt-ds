# Navigation Item

A navigation item component is a repeatable UI element that facilitates the movement and exploration within a website or application. It typically consists of a group of links, buttons, or other interactive elements that allow users to navigate between different sections, pages, or features of the system.

##### Use when

- When your website or application requires deep navigation structures, implement multi-level navigation to allow users to orient themselves whilst navigating through different levels of content hierarchy or sections.

- When a sticky or fixed navigation option that is needed, which remains visible as users scroll down the page, always ensuring they have easy access to the website or applications main navigation.

##### Don't use when

- When content lacks clear categorization or hierarchy.

- When your content is very specific, in this case, a minimalistic or single-page design may be more appropriate than a complex navigation structure.

- When the navigation becomes overly complicated, leading to confusion and difficulty for users to find what they need.

## Features

The default configuration of the navigation item comes in two orientations; horizontal or vertical. In either orientation, the width of the navigation item is customisable and can be adjusted to fit any preferred width. The navigation item contains a Link which can be selected on mouse and receive focus via keyboard interaction. When the item contains an expandable action it will display a Button instead.
