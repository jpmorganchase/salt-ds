# Navigation Item

A navigation item component is a repeatable UI element that facilitates the movement and exploration within a website or application. It typically consists of a group of links, buttons, or other interactive elements that allow users to navigate between different sections, pages, or features of the system.

##### Use when

- When your website or application requires deep navigation structures, implement multi-level navigation to allow users to orient themselves whilst navigating through different levels of content hierarchy or sections.

- When a sticky or fixed navigation option that is needed, which remains visible as users scroll down the page, always ensuring they have easy access to the website or applications main navigation.

##### Don't use when

- When content lacks clear categorization or hierarchy.

- When your content is very specific, in this case, a minimalistic or single-page design may be more appropriate than a complex navigation structure.

- When the navigation becomes overly complicated, leading to confusion and difficulty for users to find what they need.

## Features

### Horizontal (default)

The default configuration of the Navigation Item comes in a horizontal orientation.

</Canvas>

### Vertical

The orientation of the default Navigation Item can be changed by passing a vertical orientation prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-navigation-item--vertical" />
</Canvas>

### With icon

An icon can effectively signify the navigation item’s purpose, whether it’s related to a product's identity, a specific tool, function, or a configuration setting.

Tip: Ensure that icon descriptors are used consistently across all items within the same hierarchy level. This keeps the parent-child relationships clear and maintains the navigation hierarchy.

### With Badge

Navigation items can feature a [Badge](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-badge--page) that serves as a visual cue. They can inform users of additional context, notifications, signpost new content or indicate a status.

Note: A badge should only be placed in a navigation item that does not nest, i.e. it will not have a chevron.

</Canvas>

### With nested children

Navigation items that feature a chevron indicate that they are a parent item which nest additional child items inside it.

</Canvas>

### Horizontal group

Use horizontal Navigation Items within a horizontal group to establish a consistent and easily accessible pathway for users, while conserving valuable screen estate. Users will be able to easily scan and identify navigation options in a seamless user experience.

Tip: Use a horizontal group of Navigation Items when you have less than 8 items, otherwise consider a vertical group of items.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-navigation-item--horizontal-group" />
</Canvas>

### Vertical group

A vertical navigation group provides a simple, single-level list of links that users can select within an application or website.

Note: Use a vertical Navigation Item in a vertical orientation, with a descriptive [Icon](?path=/docs/documentation-icons-icon--page) and a [Badge](?path=/docs/documentation-lab-badge--page) when providing the user with a quick and informative way to assess the relevance or significance of a Navigation Item, aiding their decision-making process and overall navigation experience.

Tip: Use a vertical group of Navigation items when you have more than 8 items, otherwise, consider a horizontal group of items.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-navigation-item--vertical-group" />
</Canvas>

### Vertical group nested

Use vertical navigation when handling a hierarchical structure of nested pages, encompassing both parent and child levels of navigation items. This configuration allows users to reveal child items when selecting a parent item, facilitating an intuitive exploration of the content hierarchy.

When a vertical nested group is collapsed, and there is an active child item within it, the parent item will obtain a blur-selected state.

Note: If a Navigation Item has children, it will act as a trigger to show and hide its nested items. A parent item cannot act as a link and navigate to an overview page. If you require an overview page, use the first child item to achieve this.
