# Split layout

Defines left and right regions for UI elements within a span, such as a button bar.
By default the Split layout will break into a second row with the elements on the right hand side as soon as it finds limited space.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-layout-splitlayout--default-split-layout" />
</Canvas>

## Use Split layout when...

There are 2 defined areas that are required to be in the opposite horizontal ends of a container,
for example if 2 `ButtonBar` components need to be in a header.

### Don't use Split layout when...

Your layout requires more than 2 regions. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Flow layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flowlayout--page).

### Examples
