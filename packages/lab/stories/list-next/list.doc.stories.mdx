# List

The List component allows the user to select one or more items from an array of options—selected items are visually distinct. Long Lists are shown in a scrolling pane to provide access to all options in a space-efficient way.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-list-next--default" />
</Canvas>

### Single select

The default List allows users to make a single selection from the available options.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-list-next--default" />
</Canvas>

### Configure list height

If the List height is greater than the available space, it becomes vertically scrollable. You can control its height by using `displayedItemCount` to configure the number of items displayed—and the List height will automatically adjust. We recommend this method of setting your List height, as it ensures that all items are displayed in their entirety and not partially clipped.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-list-next--configurable-height" />
</Canvas>

## How to use

### When to use List

- To present a set of selectable options.
- To define attributes for an onward action such as filtering a data grid, grouping reports or selecting templates.

### When not to use List

- To provide navigation within an application. Use vertical navigation instead.
- To navigate options with hierarchical parent-child relationship. Instead, use components that suit your needs such as: tree, cascading menu, or menu button.
- To execute commands, or trigger the display of modal windows or dialog boxes.
- To select among a small number of options. Consider checkbox or radio button instead.
