# Input Next

Input provides an editable field in which users can enter arbitrary text and numeric values.

# Examples

## Default

Input comprises value text and a focus ring. The component is initially empty and then, once it has focus, it accepts text on a single line only.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input-next--default" />
</Canvas>

## Controlled

You can control Input with the `value` and `onChange` props. Learn more about <Link href="https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components">controlled vs uncontrolled components in the official React docs</Link>.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input-next--controlled" />
</Canvas>

## Variants

Input has two variants, primary (default) and secondary.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input-next--variants" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

You can set Input to a disabled state, with no resultant action when the user interacts with it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input-next--disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Readonly

You can set Input to a read-only state. The value text can’t be edited in this state, but it can be highlighted and copied.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input-next--readonly" />
</Canvas>

For accessibility purposes, it is recommended that you add a marker for empty read only fields via the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input—next--empty-readonly-marker" />
</Canvas>

## Text Alignment

Text alignment is left by default. This can be changed via the `textAlign` prop to “center” or “right”.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input—next--text-alignment" />
</Canvas>

## Validation

Input can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input-next--validation" />
</Canvas>

- Use the error state to alert the user of a critical issue that’s related to the input. This issue, which may jeopardize completion of the task, usually requires action from the user to resolve the error.
- Display the warning state when you need to alert the user of a potential issue—that won’t prevent the user from continuing with the task, but may cause errors if it’s not addressed.
