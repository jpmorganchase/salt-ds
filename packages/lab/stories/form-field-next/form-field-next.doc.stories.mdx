# Form Field Next

Form Field is a wrapper for UI controls that are typically found in a form (e.g., Input, Combobox, Radio Button). It is required to make these controls accessible and provides them with a visible label, validation control and descriptive text elements.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-form-field-next--default" />
</Canvas>

## Form Field Label and Helper Text

Form Field provides Form Field Label and Form Field Helper Text components which can be used within a Form Field. Use the Helper Text to provide additional guidance to users, such as when it’s not obvious what action the user must take, or if you need to show an example of acceptable formats to increase the likelihood of successful entry.

## Used with controls

## Disabled

Form Field can be disabled if the context or required permissions prevent the user from interacting with a field.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-form-field-next--disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Multiple Inputs

When using multiple controls in a single Form Field, use the Form Field Control Wrapper component for structure.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-form-field-next--multi-input" />
</Canvas>

## Readonly

Form Field can be set as readonly if you’re displaying values that are predefined and not editable, e.g., entry that’s populated and fixed by template selection.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-form-field-next--readonly" />
</Canvas>

## Label placement

Form Field Label placement can be positioned above the controls (default) or to the left via the prop `labelPlacement`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-form-field-next--label-placement" />
</Canvas>

- If your application is limited in vertical real estate, you can configure Form Field to display left-aligned labels.

## Validation

Form Fields can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-form-field-next--with-validation" />
</Canvas>

- Use the error state to alert the user of a critical issue that’s related to the field entry. This issue, which may jeopardize completion of the task, usually requires action from the user to resolve the error.

- Display the warning state when you need to alert the user of a potential issue—that won’t prevent the user from continuing with the task, but may cause errors if it’s not addressed.

## How to use

### When to use Form Field

- Use Form Field when you need to display editable components in a form layout—such as a simple form, filter panel or cash ticket.
- We highly recommend using the Form Field Label and Form Field Helper Text components within Form Field to provide your form elements with the descriptive label and validation feedback required to ensure ADA compliance.
