# Pill

Pill components provide multiple ways to label, tag or categorize content to
allow users to trigger actions, make selections or filter results.

**AKA:** Chip, Lozenge, Tag, Token

**Related components**

**Similar to:** [Badge](/?path=/story/lab-badge--all-badges),
[Link](/?path=/story/lab-link--default),
[ToggleButton](/?path=/story/toggle-button--default-button)
**Uses:** [Button](/?path=/story/core-button--cta),
[Icon](/?path=/story/core-icon--toolkit-icon),
[Tooltip](/?path=/story/lab-tooltip--default)

## Usage

Pill is a versatile, interactive and stand-alone component. It is often used to:

#### Use When

- **Tag content**
  Use a Pill to organise content that may be mapped to more than one category. It
  provides users with a way of distinguishing among different types of content and
  categories.
- **Display or remove a value**
  A Pill allows users to display or remove a value that’s been selected elsewhere
  via another mechanism, like a filter or dropdown. Options selected within Auto
  Complete or Combo Box components, for example, may be displayed alongside a Pill.
- **Trigger a quick action**
  You can configure a Pill to trigger an immediate action—such as changing the view
  of content that’s currently on display or navigating to a new page.
- **Enable an action that’s subject to change**
  Actions that may change depending on the context, and are not fixed, are best
  represented by Pills rather than buttons. In a messaging application, for example,
  Pills can be used to display quick stock responses which change so they’re appropriate
  responses to a received message.
- **Use title or sentence case** when labelling a Pill, depending on the nature of
  the label. This maintains a visual distinction between Pills and Buttons,
  which always have uppercase labels.

## Basic Pill

The default Pill is often used for tagging purposes, or to categorize content.

**Best practices**

- Position any Pill that you’re using to tag content _below_ or on the _right_
  of the related content, so that it’s not the primary focus.
- Never apply RAG (status) colors to the Pill component to differentiate between
  categories. Use [Icon Descriptor](/?path=/docs/documentation-icons-icon--page) instead.

## Clickable Pill

Pill can also be used to trigger an action that is subject to change as a result of user Pills or other factors. This Pill, for example, may be used to send an auto-generated quick response to a message. If a Pill enables an action that is fixed, and not subject to change, use a [Button](/?path=/docs/documentation-core-button--page) instead. Provide an `onClick` callback to enable clickable Pill.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-pill--clickable" />
</Canvas>

## Closable Pill

The Closable Pill represents a value that was selected via another mechanism,
and which can be removed within the Pill. It can appear on its own, for example,
alongside a complex filter panel—or within an Pill control such as
[Auto Complete](/components/autocomplete) or [Combo Box](/components/combobox).

Provide an `onClose` callback to enable closable Pill.

The close button is persistent for improved accessibility and usability.
Actioning it removes the Pill and any associated content.

**Best practices**

- Position a Closable Pill that represents a selection or filter _above_ related
  content.
- Always use a separate selection mechanism with a Closable Pill.

## Clickable and closable Pill

Clickable and Closable Pills can be combined to enable users to select a value and to remove it if necessary.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-pill--closable-clickable" />
</Canvas>

## Icon Descriptors

Icons can be displayed on the left of a Basic or Closable Pill label to visually
reinforce the theme or grouping of that Pill, and for quick recognition.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-pill--icon" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

A Pill can be set to a disabled state, with no resultant action when the user
interacts with it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-pill--disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

The Pill is accessible by assistive technologies like screen readers, and
provides full WAI-ARIA support.

### Navigating to another page

If the action triggered by a Pill navigates the user to a different page, the
‘role’ prop must be changed from ‘button’ (the default attribute) to ‘link’, to
ensure it provides an accurate role to screen readers.
