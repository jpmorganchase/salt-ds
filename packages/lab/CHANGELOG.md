# @salt-ds/lab

## 1.0.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- b1c5c32e: Move Spinner from lab to core
- 598991f8: Move `SplitLayout` from lab to core
  Changes in `SplitLayout`

  - Removed `FlexItem` wraps around `SplitLayout` children.
  - `SplitLayout` uses `startItem` and `endItem` props as children to allow for direction.
  - Added `direction` prop to `SplitLayout`.
  - Remove `wrap` since `SplitLayout` has `direction` to control wrap by breakpoints.
  - End Aligned `endItem` so the element is always at the end of the layout.

### Patch Changes

- 94423b3c: Remove the `small` and `medium` size values from `Spinner` and add a `default` size.
- 6c9e0413: Refactor Tooltip to wrap around trigger. This is to simplify the use of Tooltip by not having to use to useTooltip hook to pass the props.
  Remove `render` and `title` props, replaced by `content` prop.
  Use '@floating-ui/react' instead of '@floating-ui/react-dom-interactions', as it's deprecated.
  Remove unused TooltipContext
- f576be1e: Move useFloatingUI from Popper to utils
