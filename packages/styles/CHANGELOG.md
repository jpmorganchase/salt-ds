# @salt-ds/styles

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d78ff537: Added @salt-ds/styles and @salt-ds/window packages

  These packages are introduced to support uses of Salt in a desktop application where pop-out elements such as tooltips are rendered into separate windows with no previously added CSS.

  The insertion point where useComponentCssInjection inserts styles can be controlled via InsertionPointContext
