# Country Symbol

The CountrySymbol component enables the display of an icon representative of a country or inter-governmental organisations flag. CountrySymbols can be used singularly or as a complete package

The components are circular, as traditional flags cannot be easily interchanged with other primitive elements, such as icons or avatars. This also standardises the shape of each flag which are not all the same ratio.

The CountrySymbols are stylised and representative to allow better recognition at smaller sizes and to maintain their character within the circular form.

## Size

Each CountrySymbol has a default size across all four densities, equal to the size foundation size-base; 20px (HD), 28px (MD), 36px (LD), and 44px (TD).
The size of each CountrySymbol can be changed in multiples of the base size.

## Usage

To reduce bundle size the CountrySymbol have a separate package which must first be installed using:

`npm install @salt-ds/countries` or `yarn add @salt-ds/countries`

Each CountrySymbol component can then be imported as follows:

`import { GB } from "@salt-ds/countries";`

The following list shows all the available CountrySymbols alongside their component name and country code:

</Canvas>

## Metadata

In some applications you will only need a single CountrySymbol component and we recommend importing this individually (see above). However for other applications e.g. a country picker you would need several.

For convenience we export a mapping to simplify rendering a list of CountrySymbols and relevant information (see story code):

```
import { countrySymbolMap } from "@salt-ds/countries"
```

## Accessibility

Decorative country symbols (symbols that repeat the information already expressed by the accompanied text) should be hidden from the screen reader to avoid repetition.
If you are adding an country symbol for decorative purposes, pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to hide its label from the screen reader.
