# Country Symbol

The Country Symbol component displays an icon that represents the flag of a country or inter-governmental organization. You can use Country Symbols individually or as a complete package.

We've made the symbols circular as the traditional flag shape can't easily be interchanged with other elements, such as icons or avatars. This also standardizes the shape of each flag, even when they have different proportions.

The Country Symbols are stylized and representative—so users are more likely to recognize them at smaller sizes, and they maintain their character within the circular form.

  <Story id="country-symbols-country-symbol--salt-country-symbol" />
</Canvas>

## Size

Our base size for high density (HD) elements is 10px. However, for accessibility and visual design reasons, we don't recommend icon sizes that are smaller than 12px.
Therefore, our default HD Country Symbol icons start at 12px but they increase size in multiples of 10px—so that 2x size is 20px, 4x is 40px, etc.

To change the size of a Country Symbol, use the `size` prop to multiply the base size.

## Usage

To reduce bundle size, Country Symbols are in a separate package that you should first install using:

`npm install @salt-ds/countries` or `yarn add @salt-ds/countries`

You can then import each Country Symbol component as follows:

`import { GB } from "@salt-ds/countries";`

The following list shows every available Country Symbol alongside its country code:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="country-symbols-country-symbol--all-country-symbols-with-search" />
</Canvas>

## Metadata

If you're displaying one Country Symbol component, we recommend importing only the symbol you need.

However, to display the symbols in a Country Picker, for example, you would need several. To make it easier to render a list of all the symbols and their related information, use:

```
import { countryMetaMap } from "@salt-ds/countries"
```

and

```tsx
<LazyCountrySymbol code="code" />
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="country-symbols-country-symbol--all-country-symbols" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

If you're using Country Symbol for decorative purposes, and the country is named in accompanying text, you should hide its label from screen readers to avoid repetition.
To hide this label from screen readers, pass `aria-hidden=”true”`.
