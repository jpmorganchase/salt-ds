# Country Symbol

The CountrySymbol component displays an icon that represents the flag of a country or inter-governmental organization. You can use Country Symbols individually or as a complete package.

We've made the symbols circular, as traditional flag shape can't easily be interchanged with other elements, such as icons or avatars. This also standardizes the shape of each flag, even when they have different proportions.

The CountrySymbols are stylized and representative—so users are more likely to recognize them at smaller sizes, and they maintain their character within the circular form.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="country-symbols-country-symbol--salt-country-symbol" />
</Canvas>

## Size

A Country Symbol's default size is equal to the size set by the size-base token. The default size is different in each density.
To change the size of a Country Symbol you can use the `size` prop which will multiply the base size.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="country-symbols-country-symbol--country-symbol-multiple-sizes" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

To reduce bundle size, Country Symbols are in a separate package, which you should first install using:

`npm install @salt-ds/countries` or `yarn add @salt-ds/countries`

You can then import each Country Symbol component as follows:

`import { GB } from "@salt-ds/countries";`

The following list shows every available Country Symbol alongside its country code:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="country-symbols-country-symbol--all-country-symbols-with-search" />
</Canvas>

## Metadata

If you only need to display a single Country Symbol component, we recommend importing it individually.

However, when you're displaying the symbols in a Country Picker, for example, you would need several. To make it easier to render a list of Country Symbols and their related information you can use:

```
import { countryMetaMap } from "@salt-ds/countries"
```

and

```tsx
<LazyCountrySymbol />
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="country-symbols-country-symbol--all-country-symbols" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

Decorative country symbols (symbols that repeat the information already expressed by the accompanied text) should be hidden from the screen reader to avoid repetition.
If you are adding an country symbol for decorative purposes, pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to hide its label from the screen reader.
