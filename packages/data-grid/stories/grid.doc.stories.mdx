# Grid

A grid presents tabular information that has columns and rows.
The grid is particularly useful if the tabular information is editable or interactive, various use cases include:

- Data input, such as editing notional values
- Real-time data display, such as executed trades
- Inline cell or row-based actions, such as cancelling trades

The grid provides users with intuitive and efficient keyboard navigation, filtering, content editing, selection, and copy and paste.

The grid is virtualized. Only the visible part is rendered to the DOM.

## Configuring Grid

To install the `@salt-ds/data-grid` package, run the command relevant to your environment:

```sh
yarn add @salt-ds/data-grid;
```

```sh
npm install @salt-ds/data-grid;
```

To import the grid into your application, use the following import:

```js
import { Grid, GridColumn } from "@salt-ds/data-grid";
```

<Banner disableAnnouncer>
  Note: ensure the CSS `height` property for the grid element has been set
  appropriately to see grid on screen. You can do so by passing a custom class
  name, using a style prop, or by targeting the default `.saltGrid` class name.

### Props

<ArgsTable of={Grid} />

## Grid variants

The grid contains two variants:

1. `primary`: the default mode. Zebra is available on `primary` variant, by using `zebra={true}`
2. `secondary`

Column separators can be enabled using the `columnSeparators` property.

    <Story id="data-grid-data-grid--grid-variants" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

### Columns

The grid columns can be configured using the `GridColumn` component.

The grid package contains three types of predefined columns:

- `RowSelectionCheckboxColumn`: cell values of type `RowSelectionCheckboxCellValue` contain checkboxes, allow multiple selection and values are left aligned by default.
- `RowSelectionRadioColumn`: cell values of type `RowSelectionRadioCellValue` contain radio buttons, allow single selection only and values are left aligned by default.
- `NumericColumn`: cell values of type `NumericCellValue`, values are right aligned only.

Each one of them renders a `GridColumn` with a specific set of props.
You can easily create any project-specific column types tailored to your needs using the same approach.

#### GridColumn props

<ArgsTable of={GridColumn} />

### Column groups

Columns can be grouped using the `ColumnGroup` component.

Note: whenever a `ColumnGroup` component is present, all other grids' children will also need to be wrapped within a `ColumnGroup` component.

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story id="data-grid-data-grid--column-groups" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

### Rows

The grid rows are created by providing an array of objects in the `rowData` property of the grid.
`rowData` also accepts [sparse arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-meant-by-sparse-array/), array where most of the elemeents have values zero or null.
When used in combination with the `onVisibleRowRangeChange` callback this allows for lazy loading (server-side data) scenarios.

[Here's an example](https://saltdesignsystem-storybook.pages.dev/?path=/story/data-grid-data-grid--server-side-data) that details using sparse array and `onVisibleRowRangeChange` callback.

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story id="data-grid-data-grid--server-side-data" />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

### Row selection

The grid supports three variants of row selection:

- Single row selection
- Multi-row selection
- None (rows cannot be selected)

`RowSelectionCheckboxColumn` is useful in `multi` row selection mode, and `RowSelectionRadioColumn` works best in `single` row selection mode.
Both are optional.

#### Uncontrolled mode

In [uncontrolled mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) you can provide `defaultSelectedRowIdxs` and the grid maintains the selection state. It accepts `number[]`, and works only when `rowSelectionMode` is `single` or `multi`.

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story
      id="data-grid-data-grid--row-selection-modes"
      decorators={[withFlexGap]}
    />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

#### Controlled mode

In [controlled mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) you can provide `selectedRowIdxs` and update it when the `onRowsSelected` callback is invoked.
Below is an example of how to use controlled selection mode to synchronize selection in two grids.

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story
      id="data-grid-data-grid--row-selection-controlled"
      decorators={[withFlexGap]}
    />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

### Cell customization

The grid allows the use of any renderable react components for cell customization. There are two ways to customize cell appearance:

- `cellValueComponent` (recommended)
- `cellComponent`

The `cellValueComponent` property of `GridColumn` component is the most convenient extension point. It handles cell values and functionalities like on-hover highlighting, selection, cursor and focus.
Below is an example of custom components applied to `cellValueComponent` of "Bid/Ask", "Percentage" and "Buttons" columns, [more details here](https://saltdesignsystem-storybook.pages.dev/?path=/story/data-grid-data-grid--cell-customization).

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story
      id="data-grid-data-grid--cell-customization"
      decorators={[withFlexGap]}
    />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

The second way to customize cell appearance is the `cellComponent` property. Unlike
`cellValueComponent` it replaces the entire cell element rather than its content
and allows you to implement more radical customization scenarios. Please note that
if you override `cellComponent` you will need to handle all basic functionality typically
provided by the default cell implementation, therefore it is recommended that you
only use `cellComponent` if `cellValueComponent` does not provide enough flexibility.

### Header customization

Column headers and column group headers can be customized using the `headerValueComponent` property which is demonstrated by the grid below.

- The "Items sold" column group has a group of toggle buttons that change the appearance of the group between "monthly", "quarterly" and "summary" modes.
- The "Item" column group has a button to toggle between pinned and unpinned modes.
- The "Name" and "Price" columns have custom headers that indicate sort direction.

This grid also shows an example of a custom cell displaying a basic chart. Switch the "Items sold" column to "summary" mode to see it.

    <Story
      id="data-grid-data-grid--header-customization"
      decorators={[withFlexGap]}
    />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

### Editable cells

The grid allows you to make cell values editable in place.

Use the `CellEditor` (a non-rendered) component as a child of `GridColumn` to make the column editable.
A [non-rendered component, a.k.a. renderless component](https://kyleshevlin.com/renderless-components) is a reusable React component that renders nothing
i.e. `return null`, used mainly to manage data and state.
`CellEditor` is expected to have one child representing the specific editor component to use for the column.
The child of the `CellEditor` component gets rendered in the focused cell when the grid goes to edit mode.

We have [two sample components](https://saltdesignsystem-storybook.pages.dev/?path=/story/data-grid-data-grid--editable-cells) created for use as `CellEditor`'s child,
i.e. `TextCellEditor` and `NumericCellEditor`.
You can easily create any components tailored to your needs using the same approach.

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story
      id="data-grid-data-grid--editable-cells"
      decorators={[withFlexGap]}
    />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

To trigger edit mode on cells on your:

- keyboard: press either the `backspace` _or_ `F2` key, _alternatively_ simply start typing
- mouse: double click

### Column sorting

The grid allows you to sort individual columns on client side or server side, use `sortable`on `GridColumn` component to enable this.

For client side sorting, user could use inbuilt default sort, or provide a custom sorting function through `customSort`, see "Score" column for example.

For server side sorting, we expose sort order (`asc | desc | none`) through `onSortOrderChange`, see "Amount" column for example.

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story id="data-grid-data-grid--client-side-sort" />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story id="data-grid-data-grid--server-side-sort" />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

### Cell Validation

To display a cell in one of the expected validation states, use the `getValidationState` prop on the `GridColumn` component. This prop is a function that provides row and column data and expects a return value of one of the known validation states, "error", "warning", and "success".
Optionally, you can provide a custom accessibility label with the `getValidationMessage` prop. If you don't provide a custom message yourself, the default message will be `Cell validation state is ${status}`.

Another optional prop to customize the validation is `validationType`. This can be either "strong" or "light". The default value is "light". Both options only apply visual styling. You will need to provide the validation logic yourself.
The first validation type "light", applies a status color to the background and border,
while the second type "strong" additionally displays a status icon. Light validation is supposed to be used with non-editable cells, and strong with editable cells.

If you are validating editable cells, for the business logic, we recommend you use a 3rd party library like [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup) or [zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="data-grid-data-grid--cell-validation" decorators={[withFlexGap]} />
</Canvas>

### Row Validation

Grid provides an api for row-level validation with the prop `getRowValidationStatus`. This function provides the row data as the argument, and expects a return value that is one of the cell validation states, "error", "warning", and "success".
In most cases, it should be used together with the `RowValidationColumn` component to give the user a visual indicator of the validation state besides background color. This is important for accessibility.

### Pagination

[Implement pagination](https://saltdesignsystem-storybook.pages.dev/?path=/story/lab-pagination--default-pagination) using the `Paginator` component. It is not a feature of the grid itself.

_Note: the paginator component is currently an experimental feature, works are in progress._

```
import { Pagination, Paginator } from "@salt-ds/lab";

interface PaginationProps {
  count: number
  page?: number
  onPageChange?: ((page: number) => void)
  initialPage?: number
  compact?: Boolean
}

interface PaginatorProps {
  boundaryCount?: number;
  siblingCount?: number;
  showPreviousNext?: boolean;
  FormFieldProps?: Partial<FormFieldProps>;
}
```

<LazyStoryCanvas>
  <Canvas>
    <Story
      id="data-grid-data-grid--grid-pagination"
      decorators={[withFlexGap]}
    />
  </Canvas>
</LazyStoryCanvas>

### Writing tests for Grid component

The grid utilizes virtualization to load content and renders only what’s in the viewport.
As previously fetched data leave the viewport (rows/columns scrolled out of view in grid), so do the DOM nodes.

Note: if your test expects an element to be rendered, and it is out of the viewport, the test will not find the element - that is expected behaviour.
Virtual DOM environments like JSDOM in Jest do not have any dimensions, therefore will not render any rows. We recommend using Cypress for testing the grid.
To make tests work, ensure your grid is big enough and have scrolling implemented, closely mimicking how a user would experience using it.
