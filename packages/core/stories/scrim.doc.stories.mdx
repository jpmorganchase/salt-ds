# Scrim

A Scrim is a temporary, semi-transparent layer that makes underlying content less prominent.

As a backdrop, it brings an overlaying component—such as as [Dialog](/docs/lab-dialog--basic-dialog) to the forefront of the user interface, drawing attention to this content.

## Usage

Use a Scrim to focus the user’s attention on the content of an overlaying component within a specific viewport or content area. Place it in an application window, widget, data visualization or panel, such as a [Dialog](/docs/lab-dialog--basic-dialog).

**Best practice**  
Don’t use a Scrim if the user needs to interact with the content beneath the overlaying component at the same time, for example, in a master detail layout.

## Interactions and behaviors

**Modal experience**  
The Scrim provides a modal experience by obscuring the underlying content. It also prevents keyboard or mouse interactions from reaching this content until the Scrim and overlaying component are closed by the user or system.

## Default

When triggered, the basic Scrim fills the application window and blocks user interaction with the underlying content, until it’s closed. It is often displayed as the backdrop to another component, as demonstrated in this example.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-scrim--default-scrim" />
</Canvas>

## Closable Scrim

If required for your particular use case, you can configure the Scrim to be closable on mouse click or keyboard interaction.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-scrim--closable-scrim" />
</Canvas>

## Scrim in a container

You can display a Scrim within a container such as a [Card](/docs/documentation-core-card--card) or to temporarily block interaction while the container content is loading or unavailable.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-scrim--scrim-container" />
</Canvas>

## --uitkScrim CSS Custom Property API

The default styling values for most Scrim attributes are hard-coded values local to Scrim.

The CSS custom properties below are consumed by Scrim, but not defined by Scrim. They can be defined via a container or
a custom class name to override button styling. They will always take precedence over default styles, whether from theme variable
or declared locally. See Theme documentation for guidance on when to use variables from the Custom Property API.

<CSSVariableTable of={Scrim} />

## Accessibility

The Scrim component is accessible by screen readers and provides full WAI ARIA support.

**Focus Trap**  
For accessibility purposes, the key responsibility of the Scrim component is to block interaction with the underlying page.

This has two consequences:

1. The tab order is restricted, only cycling through items within the overlaying component.
2. Content beneath the scrim is programmatically disabled to stop Assistive Technologies from conveying it to users.

**Keyboard interactions**  
The following keyboard interactions apply:

| Key               | Function                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <kbd>Escape</kbd> | Closes the Scrim and the associated overlaying component. Note: Provided the Escape key isn’t absorbed by an active component. |
