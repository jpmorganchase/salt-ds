# Panel

A panel is a way to organize content areas in an application (both web and desktop). It provides expand/collapse behavior, it can have it's own scroll bar, and has "floating" and "docked" states. When a panel is removed from the application window it becomes a child window.

## Panel Component

Panel components have two levels of emphasis; medium (default) and high.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Panels" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <Panel>This is a panel around some text.</Panel>
    <Panel emphasis="high">
      This is a panel around some text with high emphasis.
    </Panel>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## --uitkPanel CSS Custom Property API

The default styling values for most Panel attributes are provided by the theme variables. A smaller number of attributes
use hard-coded values local to Panel. Both of these can be overridden, see Theme documentation for detailed usage guidance.

The CSS custom properties below are consumed by Panel, but not defined by Panel. They can be defined via a container or
a custom class name to override card styling. They will always take precedence over default styles, whether from theme variable
or declared locally. Again, see Theme documentation for guidance on when to use variables from the Custom Property API.
