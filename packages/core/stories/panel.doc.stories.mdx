# Panel

A panel is a way to organize content areas in an application (both web and desktop). It provides expand/collapse behavior, it can have it's own scroll bar, and has "floating" and "docked" states. When a panel is removed from the application window it becomes a child window.

## Panel Component

Panel has two variants: `primary` and `secondary`. If not specified, the default value is `primary`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Panel" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <Panel>This is a panel around some text.</Panel>
    <Panel variant="secondary">
      This is a secondary panel around some text.
    </Panel>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
