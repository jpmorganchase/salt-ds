# Inline layout

Inline layout dictates a horizontal order and direction for UI elements.
It builds from flex layout, the width is driven by the child elements, and there are visual separators that can be turned on/off (default) between items.

It can be used to layout static components or information in a horizontal orientation, such as metric data displays, contact information or page filters.

  <Story id="core-layout-inlinelayout--default-inline-layout" />

## Use Inline layout when...

You need a layout that is consistently horizontal and either scrollable or you want to use breakpoints for responsiveness.

### Don't use Inline layout when...

You want the direction to have more complex customization. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Flex layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flexlayout--page).
