# Splitter

`Splitter` divides window content into separate regions called `SplitPanel`s that can be dragged and resized, allowing users to customize the layout of their workspace.

The Salt Splitter leverages the popular open-source library react-resizable-panels, whilst making adjustments to component names, adding custom styling, and introducing extra functionality to better align with the rest of the components present in our design system.

## Remapping

| salt-ds                                      | react-resizable-panels                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `<Splitter />`                               | `<PanelGroup />`                             |
| `<SplitPanel />`                             | `<Panel />`                                  |
| `<SplitHandle />`                            | `<PanelResizeHandle />`                      |
| `SplitterProps["orientation"]["vertical"]`   | `PanelGroupProps["direction"]["horizontal"]` |
| `SplitterProps["orientation"]["horizontal"]` | `PanelGroupProps["direction"]["vertical"]`   |

## Overridden Functionality

`SplitterProps["orientation"]` - Replaced the `direction` prop with `orientation` to better align with the rest of the components present in our design system. The orientation prop takes one of two options `horizontal` and `vertical`. Keep in mind that they are the opposite of the base library's `direction` prop.

## Additional Functionality

`SplitterProps["appearance"]` - Change the appearance of the Splitter component. The appearance prop here acts similarly to `Button["appearance"]`. It can take one of two options `bordered` (default) and `transparent`. The bordered options will add a border on every nested `<SplitHandle />`, while the transparent option will make the handle transparent, thus letting through the background color of the parent component.

`SplitPanelProps["variant"]` - Change the background color of the SplitPanel component. The variant prop takes one of three options - `primary` (default), `secondary`, `tertiary`. Follows the same behavior as our Panel component.

`SplitHandle["variant"]` - Change the background color of the SplitHandle component. It behaves similarly to the `SplitPanelProps["variant"]` prop and it is meant to be used in combination with it. The variant prop can take one of three options - `primary` (default), `secondary`, `tertiary`. Follows the same behavior as our Panel component.

`SplitHandle["border"]` - Override the border placement of the SplitHandle component. The border prop takes one of seven options - `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-bottom`, `left-right`, `none`. The default value is computed based on the orientation and appearance of the parent Splitter component. If the parent splitter's orientation is `horizontal` and the appearance is `bordered`, the default value will be `top-bottom`. If the orientation is `vertical` and the appearance is `bordered`, the default value will be `left-right`. If the appearance is `transparent`, the default value will be `none`.
