# Accordion

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-accordion--default" />
</Canvas>

A pane containing summary content, which can then be expanded or collapsed to allow the user to show or hide content.

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-accordion--default" />
</Canvas>

### Group

Accordions can be placed in an Accordion Group

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-accordion--default-group" />
</Canvas>

### Exclusive Group

You can use the controlled API to create an exclusive accordion group. This means that only one accordion can be open at a time.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-accordion--exclusive-group" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Accordions can be disabled by passing the `disabled` prop to the Accordion component.
This will prevent the accordion from being expanded, collapsed or focused.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-accordion--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Status

Accordions can be set to either "error", "warning" or "success".
This should be used to indicate the status of the content within the accordion.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-accordion--status" />
</Canvas>
