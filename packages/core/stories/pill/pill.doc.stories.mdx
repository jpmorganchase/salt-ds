# Pill

Pill is a small visual element that contains versatile content. You can use Pill to label, tag or categorize content. With Pill, users can trigger actions, make selections or filter results. Actions that may change depending on the context, and are not fixed, are better represented by Pill than Button.

## Usage

Pill is a versatile, interactive and stand-alone component. It is often used to:

### When to use Pill

- Organize content that may be mapped to more than one category. This provides users with a way of distinguishing different types of content and categories.
- Trigger an immediate action—such as changing the view of content that’s currently on display or navigating to a new page.
- Enable an action that’s subject to change. Actions that may change depending on the context, and are not fixed, are better represented by Pill than Button. In a messaging application, for example, Pills can be used to display quick stock responses that change so they’re appropriate responses to received message.

### When not to use Pill

- When the content is a system message and cannot be interacted with. Use Badge instead.

## Basic Pill

The default Pill is often used for tagging purposes, or to categorize content. Pill can be used to trigger an action that is subject to change as a result of using Pills or other factors. This Pill, for example, may be used to send an auto-generated quick response to a message. If a Pill enables an action that is fixed, and not subject to change, use a [Button](/docs/documentation-core-button--docs) instead.

**Best practices**

- Position any Pill you’re using to tag content below or on the right
  of the related content, so that it’s not the primary focus.
- Never apply RAG (status) colors to the Pill component to differentiate between
  categories. Use [Icon Descriptor](/docs/documentation-icons-icon--docs) instead.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-pill--default" />
</Canvas>

## Icon Descriptors

Icons can be displayed on the left of the Pill label to visually
reinforce the theme or grouping of that Pill, and for quick recognition.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-pill--icon" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

A Pill can be set to a disabled state, with no resultant action when the user
interacts with it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-pill--disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Accessibility

The Pill is accessible by assistive technologies such as screen readers, and
provides full WAI-ARIA support.

### Navigating to another page

If the action triggered by a Pill navigates the user to a different page, the
‘role’ prop must be changed from ‘button’ (the default attribute) to ‘link’, to
ensure it provides an accurate role to screen readers.

| Enter or Space | Clickable Pill:<br /> - When focus is on Pill, it’s activated.                                                                                         |
| Tab            | - Moves focus into Pill, setting focus to the entire Pill.<br/> - When Pill has focus, moves focus out of Pill to the next component in the tab order. |
| Shift + Tab    | When Pill has focus, moves focus out of Pill to the previous component in the tab order.                                                               |
