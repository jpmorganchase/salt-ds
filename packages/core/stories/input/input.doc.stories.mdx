# Input

Input provides an editable field in which users can enter text and numeric values.

## Examples

### Default

Input comprises value text and a focus ring. The component is initially empty. Once it has focus, it accepts text on a single line.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input--default" />
</Canvas>

### Controlled

You can control Input with the `value` and `onChange` props. Learn more about <Link href="https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components">controlled vs. uncontrolled components</Link> in the official React docs.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input--controlled" />
</Canvas>

### Variants

Input has two variants: primary (default) and secondary.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input--variants" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

You can set Input to a disabled state, with no resultant action when the user interacts with it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Read-only

You can set Input to a read-only state. The value text can’t be edited in this state, but it can be highlighted and copied.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input--readonly" />
</Canvas>

For accessibility purposes, we recommend that you add a marker for empty read-only fields via the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop. This makes the field easier to be seen amongst other UI elements, indicating its read-only status.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input--empty-readonly-marker" />
</Canvas>

### Text Alignment

Text is aligned to the left by default. Use the `textAlign` prop to change to “center” or “right”.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input--text-alignment" />
</Canvas>

### Validation

Input can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input--validation" />
</Canvas>

- Use the error state to alert the user of a critical issue that’s related to the input. Issues highlighted by an error state may jeopardize completion of the task and usually require action from the user to resolve the error.
- Display the warning state to alert the user of a potential issue that won’t prevent the user from continuing with the task, but may cause errors if it’s not addressed.
