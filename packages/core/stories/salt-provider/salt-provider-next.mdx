# Salt Provider Next

The new Salt Provider introduces Salt's next phase theming capability with more styling options, including
rounded corners, balanced color palettes, etc. Features will be introduced gradually over time and we're
encouraging teams needing this to test to give us feedback.

It extends existing [Salt Provider](/?path=/docs/documentation-core-salt-provider--docs) so existing options
are still available (e.g. light/dark mode, high/medium/low/touch density). Additional props will be made available
to switch between different look.

To use the new Salt Provider, you need to swap any existing `SaltProvider` to use the new `UNSTABLE_SaltProviderNext`,
and also import a new theme CSS.

```js static
// Swap out existing SaltProvider
import { UNSTABLE_SaltProviderNext } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

```js static
// Alongside with existing `import "@salt-ds/theme/index.css";`
import "@salt-ds/theme/css/theme-next.css";
```

The new provider adds additional `.salt-theme-next` to either the root or provider element, together with
any additional data attributes (e.g. `data-corner`) needed for new props.

All values within `theme-next.css` will be scoped to `.salt-theme-next` to make sure any replacement values
(like new color palettes) could override existing values in `.salt-theme`.

## Corner radius

Although default Salt design language stays sharp corners to serve our institutional clients,
rounded corners can be made available to many components to achieve a softer, consumer friendly feel.

The `corner` prop can be used to toggle between `"sharp"` (default) and `"rounded"`.

```tsx
<UNSTABLE_SaltProviderNext corner="rounded">
```

### Token Structure

A new set of foundation token (curve) is added with below values

| Foundation Token   | HD    | MD    | LD    | TD    |
| ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `--salt-curve-0`   | 0     | 0     | 0     | 0     |
| `--salt-curve-50`  | 1px   | 2px   | 3px   | 4px   |
| `--salt-curve-100` | 2px   | 4px   | 6px   | 8px   |
| `--salt-curve-150` | 3px   | 6px   | 9px   | 12px  |
| `--salt-curve-999` | 999px | 999px | 999px | 999px |

A new set of palette token (corner) is added with below mapping

| Palette Token                     | Sharp              | Rounded            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| `--salt-palette-corner-weaker`    | `--salt-curve-0`   | `--salt-curve-50`  |
| `--salt-palette-corner-weak`      | `--salt-curve-0`   | `--salt-curve-100` |
| `--salt-palette-corner`           | `--salt-curve-0`   | `--salt-curve-150` |
| `--salt-palette-corner-strongest` | `--salt-curve-999` | `--salt-curve-999` |

- Banner
- Card
- Dialog
- File drop zone
- Overlay

- Avatar
- Badge

## Heading font switch

A new `headingFont` prop is added to switch display and heading font family between Open Sans and Amplitude.

```
<UNSTABLE_SaltProviderNext headingFont="Amplitude">
```

You'll need to install Amplitude font to your application to make sure every user will see the font correctly, e.g.,

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Amplitude";
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url("PATH/TO/FONT.woff2") format("woff2");
}
```

## Unified Color Palette

A completely new color palette is used with balanced color ramps for each color group.

You will find 9 colors in each color group, which makes sure middle point (500 colors) will achieve
at least 4.5 contrast ratio against both light and dark primary background. Primary and secondary
background colors are no longer picked from the color ramps, but rather from additional foundation
colors (snow & marble in light, jet & granite in dark).

Refer to Figma file ([UNSTABLE Salt Colors (variables)](<https://www.figma.com/file/e753bB0n5Adc0LCXqtvslu/UNSTABLE-Salt-Colors-(variables)?type=design&node-id=424%3A77224&mode=design&t=1snosiQ76rKnIe9d-1>))
for color values and mappings.

Migration note: If you're referring any Salt foundation colors (i.e. `--salt-color-*`) directly in your code,
you'll need to revisit those values. We do not recommend directly consume foundation colors directly, instead
try to find a characteristics color instead which will work better in different modes.

## New Theme Palette Structure

A new structure of palette layer is introduced to help making color changes easier for custom themes, namely

- Accent
- Background
- Foreground
- Neutral
- Info
- Negative
- Positive
- Warning

All existing characteristics are re-wired through above new palette layers to use the new colors,
which is scoped to `.salt-theme-next`.
