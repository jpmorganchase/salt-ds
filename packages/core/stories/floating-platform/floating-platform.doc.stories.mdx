## Custom Floating UI Platform

Note: The following section should not be necessary for the majority of users and is only fot specialized use-cases of floating components

### Background

Certain components within the design system use 'floating' . These are elements which are anchored to another component, but appear outside of the normal flow of the document, and re-position themselves according to factors such as proximity to the edge of the document. Salt uses [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com) to implement these aspect of our components.

In certain specialized use-cases consumers may want to customize the behavior of floating-ui. For example when dealing with multi-window applications, where floating components should spawn in a new window and re-position with proximity to the user's screen.

### Custom Platforms

To facilitate this advanced usage consumers can pass a custom platform, based on [Floating UI's Platform feature](https://floating-ui.com/docs/platform)

You can provide a custom Floating UI platform to be used in these components by importing `<FloatingPlatformProvider>` and passing a custom [Floating UI Platform](https://floating-ui.com/docs/platform) as the `platform` prop. This will then be used within the floating component.

### Custom Middleware

Using the `FloatingPlatformProvider` you can also pass custom [Floating UI Middleware](https://floating-ui.com/docs/middleware) to be applied on top of the defaults for tweaking the position of floating components using the `middleware` prop.

The `middleware` prop takes a function which is passed the default middleware used by a component. As a consumer you can then choose to replace it:

```
const customMiddleware = [offset(10)];
const middleware = (defaultMiddleware) => customMiddleware;

```

or extend it

```
const customMiddleware = [offset(10)];
const middleware = (defaultMiddleware) => ([...defaultMiddleware, ...customMiddleware]);

```

### Custom Auto-update

You can also adjust the autoUpdate functionality to run on animation frame (e.g. to keep a Tooltip in sync with an external moving window) using the `animationFrame` prop.

### Full example

```
import { platform, offset } from "@floating-ui/dom";
import { FloatingPlatformProvider, Tooltip } from "@salt-ds/core";

const customPlatfrom = {
    ...platform,
    // Add custom platform configuration
}

const customMiddleware = [offset(10)];

const CustomFloatingPlatformTooltip = ({...props}) => {
    return (
        <FloatingPlatformProvider
            platform={customPlatform}
            animationFrame
            middleware={(defaultMiddleware) => ([...defaultMiddleware, ...customMiddleware])}
          >
            <Tooltip {...props} />
        </FloatingPlatformProvider>
    )
}

```

### Custom Floating Compoennt

You may also need to pass a custom component to be used as the root of the floating component (e.g. to spawn an external window). This can be achieved by importing `<FloatingComponentProvider>` and providing a component. This component can be used as the trigger to spawn a new window, or other advanced functionality.

This custom component will probably need to use [FloatingPortal](https://floating-ui.com/docs/FloatingPortal) and also add a `SaltProvider` at it's root.

```
import { Salt } from "@salt-ds/core";
import { FloatingComponentProvider } from "@salt-ds/window";
import { FloatingPortal } from "@floating-ui/react";
```

```
const FloatingComponent = forwardRef(
  (
    props: CombinedFloatingComponentProps,
    ref: ForwardedRef<HTMLDivElement>
  ) => {
    const { open, disabled, ...rest } = props;
    return open && !disabled ? (
      <FloatingPortal>
        <SaltProvider>
          <div {...rest} ref={ref} />
        </SaltProvider>
      </FloatingPortal>
    ) : null;
  }
);

const CustomFloatingComponentTooltip = ({...props}) => {
    return (
        <FloatingComponentProvider
            Component={FloatingComponent}
        >
            <Tooltip {...props} />
        </FloatingComponentProvider>
    )
}
```

### Custom Platform Example

The following example shows the two providers in action. The application is rendered in an iframe, representing a windowed application inside a global coordinate space (e.g. a users desktop).

When the Button is hovered the Tooltip is rendered in it's own iframe (representing a popout window) which has been portalled to the global coordinate space.

The example uses the `FloatingComponentProvider` to trigger creating the new window when the Tooltip is opened.

It also uses the `FloatingPlatformProvider` to customize the positioning of the Tooltip based on the global coordinates of the anchor, rather than the position within it's own window.

</Canvas>

### Custom Middleware Example

In the following example custom `offset` middleware has been added to offset the tooltip by an additional amount on top of the default

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-floating-platform--custom-middleware" />
</Canvas>

### Animation Frame autoUpdate

In the following example the Tooltip is being positioned on animation frame, allowing it to remain anchored to a component suring an animation

  <Story id="core-floating-platform--animation-frame" />
</Canvas>
