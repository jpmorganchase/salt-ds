# Aria Announcer

The `AriaAnnouncer` reliably generates speech, via a screen reader, that
describes the current interaction or experience to assistive technology users.
It provides accessibility support for Salt components, as well as your own
application.

## Get Started

`AriaAnnouncer` usually requires no configuration as it is included in your app when you use a `SaltProvider`. Because only one instance of
`AriaAnnouncer` is ever required, only the outermost instance of `SaltProvider` will instantiate the `AriaAnnouncer`. If you use
nested Salt Providers, these will not inject further instances of `AriaAnnouncer`.

```jsx
import { SaltProvider } from "@salt-ds/core";

<SaltProvider>
  <MyApp />
</SaltProvider>;
```

Note that some component examples have the provider in their code, but this is
only for demonstration purposes.

Even if you don't use any of the functionality below directly, it's likely that
you may still require it as some components have built-in functionality which
relies on it. Otherwise, a console warning will be triggered each time an event
relying on it is fired.

## Usage

WAI-ARIA specification doesn’t always cater for the finer details that screen
reader users need to know, for a fully interactive experience. As a result,
screen readers may omit important events, compromising the experience of their
users.

Use this component to trigger the announcement of significant, relevant events
that screen readers might not ordinarily detect—and to customize specific
announcements to their context on a per component basis.

## useAriaAnnouncer

You can use the `useAriaAnnouncer` hook to provide announcement message for
screen readers. Destructure `announce` from the hook and call it with a string
when needed, e.g., in an event callback.

The example below demonstrates how text can be announced during a button click
event.

```jsx
import { useAriaAnnouncer } from "@salt-ds/core";

function MyComponent() {
  const { announce } = useAriaAnnouncer();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        announce("This will be announced to the screen reader.");
      }}
    >
      Click
    </button>
  );
}
```

The `announce` function takes an optional second argument which is the delay in milliseconds before the message should be announced.

```jsx
import { useAriaAnnouncer } from "@salt-ds/core";

function MyComponent() {
  const { announce } = useAriaAnnouncer();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        announce(
          "This will be announced to the screen reader with 500ms delay.",
          500
        );
      }}
    >
      Click
    </button>
  );
}
```
