# Button Bar

This pattern displays groups of core and secondary actions as buttons.

## Basic Button Bar

A simple bar with a 'Cancel' and a 'Save' button. The buttons in the Button Bar are ordered from right to left, in order of importance. The highest priority action is represented by a CTA button, on the far right.

  <Story id="patterns-button-bar--button-bar" />
</Canvas>

## With Secondary Button

You should display lower-priority actions as secondary buttons on the left, set apart from the primary actions.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="patterns-button-bar--with-secondary" />
</Canvas>

## Full Page

In a full-page layout, such as a form, users typically scan down the page first and then across. When the Button Bar is integrated into this layout, we recommend left-aligning it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="patterns-button-bar--full-page" />
</Canvas>

## Destructive Actions

To prevent destructive actions being executed accidentally, set them apart from the user’s main focus of attention—ideally, opposite the primary action in the Button Bar.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="patterns-button-bar--destructive-actions" />
</Canvas>

## Stacked

For improved usability at smaller screen or app resolutions, the Button Bar can support button stacking when it reaches a specific viewport width or application breakpoint.
