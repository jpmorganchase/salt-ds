# Drawer

A Drawer is an expandable panel that users can open and close with a sliding animation.

Use this component to display content as an overlay within the application layout. With Drawer, the user can view additional content without navigating away from the current screen.

## How to use

Use this component by wrapping it around your content and setting the desired position. For example:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-drawer--default" />
</Canvas>

Provide a component like a Button so that users can open and close the Drawer.

The Drawer displays a visual overlay, also known as a scrim, over the existing content. It also plays relevant animations when opening and closing. You can customize all of these visuals via CSS.

### When to use Drawer

Use Drawer when you need additional content, such as a form or sidebar navigation, to be displayed in a specific area of the screen.

### When not to use Drawer

If you want your content split between pages or tabs, consider Deck Layout instead.

## Features

### Drawer positioning

The component will be displayed in the left position by default but you can customize this via the `position` prop as per the following examples.

#### Top positioned

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-drawer--top" />
</Canvas>

#### Right positioned

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-drawer--right" />
</Canvas>

#### Left positioned

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-drawer--default" />
</Canvas>

#### Bottom positioned

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-drawer--bottom" />
</Canvas>

## Configuring Drawer

### API
