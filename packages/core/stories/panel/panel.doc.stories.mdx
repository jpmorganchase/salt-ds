# Panel

A panel is a way to organize content areas in an application (both web and desktop). It provides expand/collapse behavior, it can have it's own scroll bar, and has "floating" and "docked" states. When a panel is removed from the application window it becomes a child window.

## Panel Component

Panel has two variants: `primary` and `secondary`. If not specified, the default value is `primary`.
