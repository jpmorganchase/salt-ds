# Grid layout

Defines an equally distributed layout system using columns and rows.
The grid layout defaults to a twelve column grid with 1 row but you can customize it using the `columns` and `rows` props.
For more complex layouts, it supports spanning across columns and rows.

## Use Grid layout when...

Your content is best displayed using a configurable number of columns and rows.

Grid layout can take any number of children, and will by default display them in a 12 columns grid (items after the 12th one will wrap).
In order to change the number of columns displayed in the grid, you can reduce or increase the `columns` prop.

Grid layout is useful when you want to control the layout in both row and columns dimensions and it can achieve more complex forms when used in combination with `GridItems`.

### Don't use Grid layout when...

You want your layout to flow in a single dimension. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Stack layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-stacklayout--page), [Flow layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flowlayout--page) or [Flex layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flexlayout--page).

### Examples

#### Grid Item inside default grid layout

A grid item allows more complex controls to the default behavior of a grid child, like defining how many rows or columns will it span trough and it's alignment

##### Use when

You have an item that needs to take the space of more than one row/column or when you have an item that requires a different alignment to the component's default.

  <Story id="core-layout-gridlayout-griditem--grid-item-wrapper" />
</Canvas>

#### Responsive

The grid supports the use of responsive props, so you can define different behaviors based on viewport size.
All grid props are responsive, and their values can be individually customized per breakpoint.  
You can use the default breakpoints or pass in you own.

##### Use when

The flow of the grid is dependant on the viewport size.

  <Story id="core-layout-gridlayout--grid-layout-responsive-view" />
</Canvas>

#### Simple usage

The simple usage example shows `GridLayout` and `GridItems` being used to build a page footer where the first column takes up the most amount of space.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-gridlayout--grid-layout-footer" />
</Canvas>

#### Composite usage

The composite usage example shows a responsive blog built using `ResponsiveProps`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-gridlayout--grid-layout-composite" />
</Canvas>

## Configuring Grid layout

### API

```
import { GridLayout, GridItem } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";
```

### Props

**ResponsiveProp** refers to a prop that takes either multiple values (one per breakpoint) or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes.
For the following example, we can think about a layout that will responsively change from 12 columns to 2 and then to 1 as the space decreases.

```
columns={{ xs: 1, sm: 2, lg: 12, md: 12, xl: 12 }}
```

<ArgsTable of={GridLayout} />
