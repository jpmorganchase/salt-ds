# Grid Layout

Defines an equally distributed layout system using columns and rows.

The grid layout defaults to a twelve column grid with 1 row but you can customise it using the `columns` and `rows` props.

For more complex layouts, supports spanning across columns and rows

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-gridlayout--toolkit-grid-layout" />
</Canvas>

## API

```
import { GridLayout, GridItem } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-lab";
```

## Props

**ResponsiveProp** refers to a prop than take either multiple values (one per breakpoint) or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes

```
columns={{ lg: 12, md: 12, sm: 2, xl: 12, xs: 1 }}
```

### Grid Layout Props

<ArgsTable of={GridLayout} />

### Grid Item Props

<ArgsTable of={GridItem} />

## Usage Examples

### Grid Item inside default grid layout

A grid item allows more complex controls to the default behaviour of a grid child, like defining how many rows or columns will it span trough and it's alignment

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-gridlayout-griditem--grid-item-wrapper" />
</Canvas>

### Responsive

The grid supports the use of responsive props, so you can defined different behaviours based on viewport size.
All grid props are responsive, and their values can be individually customised per breakpoint.  
You can use the default breakpoints or pass in you own

<Canvas>
  <h4>Grid with responsive rows and columns</h4>
  <Story id="core-layout-gridlayout--toolkit-grid-layout-responsive-view" />
</Canvas>
