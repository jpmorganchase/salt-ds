# Flow Layout

Flow layout dictates a horizontal order and direction for UI elements.
It builds from flex layout, the height is driven by the child elements, and there are visual separators that can be turned on/off (default) between items.

It can be used for cases in which the direction needs to be consistently horizontal, for example a interdependent group of buttons.

  <Story id="core-layout-flowlayout--default-flow-layout" />
</Canvas>

## How you can use Flow layout

Flow is responsive by default and will break into two rows as soon as there is not enough space.

If you want the direction to have more complex customization, we recommend you having a look at [Flex layout](?path=/docs/layout-docs-lab-flexlayout--page).

## API

```
import { FlowLayout } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-lab";
```

## Props

<ArgsTable of={FlowLayout} />

## Examples

### Simple Usage

The simple usage example shows a group of elements inside a flow wrapper that wraps by default.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flowlayout--flow-layout-simple-usage" />
</Canvas>

### Composite Usage

The composite usage example shows 2 columns divided by a separator achieved with `FlowLayout`, with a nested `StackLayout`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flowlayout--flow-layout-composite" />
</Canvas>

## Anatomy

<Canvas>
  <ComponentAnatomy showControls={false}>
    <FlowLayout style={{ border: "dashed 1px black", padding: "1rem" }}>
      <FlowItem style={{ border: "dashed 1px black", padding: "1rem" }} />
      <FlowItem style={{ border: "dashed 1px black", padding: "1rem" }} />
    </FlowLayout>
  </ComponentAnatomy>
</Canvas>
