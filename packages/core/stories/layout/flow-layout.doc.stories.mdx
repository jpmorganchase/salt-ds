# Flow layout

Flow layout dictates a horizontal order and direction for UI elements.
It builds from flex layout, the height is driven by the child elements.

It can be used for cases in which the direction needs to be consistently horizontal, for example a interdependent group of buttons.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flowlayout--default-flow-layout" />
</Canvas>

## Use Flow layout when...

You want to build responsive layouts that will wrap into two rows as soon as there is not enough space on the viewport.

### Don't use Flow layout when...

You want the direction to have more complex customization. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Flex layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flexlayout--page).

### Examples

#### Simple usage

The simple usage example shows a group of elements inside a flow wrapper that wraps by default.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flowlayout--flow-layout-simple-usage" />
</Canvas>

#### Composite usage

The composite usage example shows 2 columns achieved with `FlowLayout`, with a nested `StackLayout`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-flowlayout--flow-layout-composite" />
</Canvas>
