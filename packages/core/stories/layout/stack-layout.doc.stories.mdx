# Stack Layout

Stack layout dictates a vertical order and direction for UI elements.
It builds from flex layout, the height is driven by the child elements, and there are visual separators that can be turned on/off (default) between items.

It can be used for cases in which the direction needs to be consistently vertical, for example a list.

## How you can use Stack layout

Stack is responsive by default and will break into two columns as soon as there is not enough space.

If you want the direction to have more complex customization, we recommend you having a look at [Flex layout](?path=/docs/layout-docs-lab-flexlayout--page).

## API

```
import { StackLayout } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-lab";
```

## Props

<ArgsTable of={StackLayout} />

## Examples

### Simple Usage

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-stacklayout--stack-layout-simple-usage" />
</Canvas>

### Composite Usage

## Anatomy

<Canvas>
  <ComponentAnatomy showControls={false}>
    <StackLayout style={{ border: "dashed 1px black", padding: "1rem" }}>
      <FlexItem style={{ border: "dashed 1px black", padding: "1rem" }} />
      <FlexItem style={{ border: "dashed 1px black", padding: "1rem" }} />
    </StackLayout>
  </ComponentAnatomy>
</Canvas>
