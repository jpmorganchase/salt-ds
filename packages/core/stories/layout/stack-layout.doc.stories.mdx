# Stack layout

Stack layout dictates a vertical order and direction for UI elements.
It builds from flex layout, the height is driven by the child elements, and there are visual separators that can be turned on/off (default) between items.

It can be used for cases in which the direction needs to be consistently vertical, for example a list.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-stacklayout--default-stack-layout" />
</Canvas>

## Use Stack layout when...

You need a layout that is responsive by default and will break into two columns as soon as there is not enough space.

### Don't use Stack layout when...

You want the direction to have more complex customization. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Flex layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flexlayout--page).

### Examples

#### Simple usage

The simple usage example shows a group of panels stacked.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-stacklayout--stack-layout-simple-usage" />
</Canvas>

#### Composite usage

The composite usage example shows a group of formfields stacked.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-stacklayout--stack-layout-composite" />
</Canvas>
