# Button

A Button executes an action when clicked. Button labels should use only one or two words, and begin with an active verb. There are three Button variants: Primary is the most commonly-used button; Secondary performs an action less likely to be triggered; Call-To-Action (a.k.a. CTA) performs a critical action on the screen.

## Button Variants

Button contains three variants `cta`, `primary` and `secondary`. If not specified, the default value is `primary`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button Variants" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <Button variant="cta">CTA</Button>
    <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
    <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Button with icon and label

Icons can be put before or after text, or used alone.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button with icon and label" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <Button variant="cta">
      Send <SendIcon size={12} />
    </Button>
    <Button variant="primary">
      <SearchIcon size={12} /> Search
    </Button>
    <Button variant="secondary">
      Setting <SettingsSolidIcon size={12} />
    </Button>
    <Button>
      <DownloadIcon size={12} />
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Button as link, div etc

Sometimes a link must be styled as a button. The HTML must use the correct element, in order that browser built-in features function as expected.
In this case, "Open link in new tab" should be available in the context menu. This is achieved with the `elementType` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button as Link">
    <Button
      elementType="a"
      href={window.location.href}
      target="_blank"
      aria-label="Button with HREF, opens in new window"
    >
      Link
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

This is also useful where Button elements might otherwise be nested, a structure which would be flagged by accessibility tests as an error. An inner button can be
rendered as a `div`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button as Div">
    <Button elementType="div" aria-label="Button as Div">
      Div Button
    </Button>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

TypeScript users, note that in the above examples, strict typing is still enforced, so if `elementType` is set to `a` then the Component will be be TypeChecked as
an `anchor` element and the attributes validated accordingly.

## Props

## HTML Anatomy of a Button

export const Link = ({ children, to, ...props }) => (
  <a {...props} href={to}>
    {children}
  </a>
);

<Canvas>
  <ComponentAnatomy>
    <Button aria-label="Simple Button">Default</Button>
  </ComponentAnatomy>
  <br />
  <ComponentAnatomy>
    <Button elementType="div" aria-label="Button as Div" variant="secondary">
      Secondary Div
    </Button>
  </ComponentAnatomy>
  <br />
  <ComponentAnatomy>
    <Button variant="cta" aria-label="CTA with Icon">
      CTA with Icon <SendIcon size={12} />
    </Button>
  </ComponentAnatomy>
  <br />
  <ComponentAnatomy>
    <Button
      elementType={Link}
      to="/"
      aria-label="Link as elementType"
      role={null}
    >
      Custom Link
    </Button>
  </ComponentAnatomy>
</Canvas>

The Custom Link example above uses a simplified `Link` component defined as below. In reality, this might be A
`RouterLink` from a routing library, for example. In this case, the `Button` does not know what root element will
be rendered by the custom Component, by default it will add the `button` role. We suppress this by explicitly
setting role = null. It will be rare to need to do this.

```javascript
export const Link = ({ children, to, ...props }) => (
  <a {...props} href={to}>
    {children}
  </a>
);
```

## Characteristics Used

## --uitkButton CSS Custom Property API

The default styling values for most Button attributes are provided by the theme variables. A smaller number of attributes
use hard-coded values local to Button. Both of these can be overridden, see Theme documentation for detailed usage guidance.

The CSS custom properties below are consumed by Button, but not defined by Button. They can be defined via a container or
a custom class name to override button styling. They will always take precedence over default styles, whether from theme variable
or declared locally. Again, see Theme documentation for guidance on when to use variables from the Custom Property API.
