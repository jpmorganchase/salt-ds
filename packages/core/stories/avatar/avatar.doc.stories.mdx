# Avatar

The Avatar component is a graphical element which can be used to represent a person, group, entity, or communication channel.

## Features

### Default Avatar

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-avatar--default" />
</Canvas>

### Sizes

Each Avatar variant has a default size across all four densities, equal to the size foundation size-base; 20px (HD), 28px (MD), 36px (LD), and 44px (TD).
The size of Avatar can be changed in multiples of the base size.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-avatar--sizes" />
</Canvas>

### Fallback

If a photo is not available, the Avatar will fall back to initials or an icon:

- `Initials` can be used when a photo is unavailable but profile information is;
- `Icon` can be used when neither a photo nor profile information are available.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-avatar--fallback" />
</Canvas>

### Alternative fallback icon

Avatar renders with an icon defined by `UserSolidIcon` but an alternative icon can be passed as `fallbackIcon`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-avatar--alternative-icon" />
</Canvas>

### Custom image or SVG

You can pass a custom image or SVG as the child of the component to be used as an image.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-avatar--with-custom-svg" />
</Canvas>

Note that for images passed as children, you will also need to handle the fallback logic.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-avatar--with-custom-img" />
</Canvas>

## Content

When using the Avatar we recommend describing what the image will represent:

- `name="Person's name"` - when the image represents a person
- `name="Group's name"` - when the image represents a group
- `name="Entity's name"` - when the image represents an entity
- `name="Channel's name"` - when the image represents a communication channel
- `name=""` - when the name is provided next to the Avatar

## Accessibility

Decorative avatars (avatars that repeat the information already expressed by the accompanied text) should be hidden from the screen reader to avoid repetition. If you are adding an avatar for decorative purposes, pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to hide its label from the screen reader.

If an alternative icon is used inside an avatar, the icon's `aria-label` should be descriptive in relation to the avatar context, not the icon context. For example, when using `<BuildingSolidIcon/>` to represent a company `aria-label` should read "Company profile" rather than the icon's default label "building solid".
