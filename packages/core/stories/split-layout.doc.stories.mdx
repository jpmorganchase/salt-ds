# Split layout

Defines regions in opposite horizontal ends for UI elements separated within a span, such as a button bar.
The Split layout is intended to work with 2 areas, and it will break into another row with the elements on the second children as soon as it finds limited space.

## Use Split layout when...

There are 2 defined areas required to be in the opposite horizontal ends of a container,
for example if 2 `ButtonBar` components need to be in a header.

### Don't use Split layout when...

Your layout requires more than 2 regions. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Flow layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flowlayout--page).
