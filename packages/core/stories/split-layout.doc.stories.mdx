# Split Layout

Defines regions in opposite horizontal/vertical ends for UI elements separated within a span, such as a button bar.
The horizontal `SplitLayout` can be controlled to break into another row based on the viewport size by the responsive prop `direction`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-split-layout--default" />
</Canvas>

## Use Split Layout when...

There are two defined areas required to be at the opposite horizontal ends of a container,
for example if two `ButtonBar` components need to be in a header.

### Don't use Split Layout when...

Your layout requires more than two regions. In this case we recommend that you consider using [Flow Layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-flow-layout--page).

### Examples
