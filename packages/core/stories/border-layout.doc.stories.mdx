# Border Layout

Defines the main content regions of an application, region or widget, such as a footer, header or side navigation.
The Border Layout is built using [Grid layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-grid-layout--page) and it is intended for laying out large sections of content, such as pages, where there is at least a main area with a header and footer.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-border-layout--all-panels" />
</Canvas>

## Use Border Layout when...

You want a fixed layout with a flexible main region.

### Don't use Border Layout when...

You want a customized layout that you can control in both row and column dimensions. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Grid layout](?path=/docs/documentation-core-layout-grid-layout--page).

### Examples

#### Border Item inside default Border Layout

The border item wrapper allows you to select the right position for your content to be displayed at - `north`, `west`, `center`, `east` or `south`.  
It also provides access to other properties such as alignment and sticky behavior.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-border-layout-border-item--border-item-wrapper" />
</Canvas>

#### Fixed panels

You can have a responsive `center` region while the `west` and `east` panels remain with a fixed width as the content changes.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-layout-border-layout--fixed-panels" />
</Canvas>
