# Card

A Card is a visually distinct container that displays a snapshot of information about a single subject, and acts as an entry point to more detailed information.

## Card Component

This default example is intended to show the way the Card componentâ€™s content can be implemented.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--default" />
</Canvas>

## Interactable Card

**Deprecated:** In previous versions, Cards could have interactable styling by setting `interactable={true}`. These cards could be wrapped in Link, for example, for interactivity. We discourage the use of any focusable elements within interactable Cards.

**Updated:** Cards can have actions by making use of the `InteractableCard` component. We discourage the use of any focusable elements within interactable Cards.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable-as-link" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled Card

**Deprecated:** In previous versions, Cards could have disabled styling applied by setting `disabled={true}`.

**Updated:** Interactable cards can currently have disabled styling applied by setting `disabled={true}`.

Make sure to also apply `disabled={true}` to any nested components, such as Text, to ensure disabled styling is also applied to the inner content.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable-disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Multiple Cards

Layout components can be used for grouping Card components together.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--cards-in-grid-layout" />
</Canvas>
