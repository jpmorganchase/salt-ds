# Card

A Card is a visually distinct container that displays a snapshot of information about a single subject, and acts as an entry point to more detailed information.

## Card Component

This default example is intended to show the way the Card component’s content can be implemented.

Content in Cards should be well-written and easily scannable. Avoid overloading a Card with too much content.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--default" />
</Canvas>

## Adding actions

If you intend to add any links or buttons within your Card, only add them into a default Card, not an interactable Card. This will ensure ADA compliance.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--default-with-link" />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--default-with-button-and-image" />
</Canvas>

## Interactable Card

Use the `InteractableCard` component to make the entire Card interactable. Do **not** use any focusable elements within Interactable Card.

To use as a link, wrap Card in a [Link](?path=/docs/documentation-core-link--docs) component.

Avoid adding too much content to Interactable Cards. It should be easily readable by all users, and it should not take too long for a screen reader tool to read out the contents.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable-as-block-link" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled Interactable Card

Set `disabled={true}` to apply disabled styling to Interactable cards.

Make sure to also apply `disabled={true}` to any nested components, such as Text, to ensure disabled styling is also applied to the inner content.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable-disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Accent Variations

Use the `accentPlacement` prop to position the accent bar left, right, top, or bottom of an Interactable Card.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable-accent-variations" />
</Canvas>

## Multiple Cards

Layout components can be used for grouping Card components together.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--cards-in-grid-layout" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

### When to use Card

- To group related information with the same visual hierarchy.
- To present a summary of a larger idea.
- To link to more detailed information.

### When not to use Card

- To display sequential information or emphasize ranking. Consider List instead.
- As a stand-alone call to action. Consider Button instead.
- For decoration purposes only.

### Do

#### All variants

- Group cards together in a layout.
- Use similar size and content length.
- Consider layout customization, if the content and size differ among Cards (i.e. Mosaic grid).

#### Interactable variant only

- Use the same accent placement in a collection.

### Don't

#### All variants

- Don’t repeat images or content in a collection.
- Don’t overload the Card with content.

#### Interactable variant only

- Don’t place two or more accent bars in the same Card.
- Don't use focusable elements - the Card is the main interactive element (for navigation or execution).
