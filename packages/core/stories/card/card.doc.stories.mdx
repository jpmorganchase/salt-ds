# Card

Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.

## Card Component

This default example is intended to show the way the Card componentâ€™s content can be implemented.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--default" />
</Canvas>

## Interactable Card

Cards can have actions by making use of `InteractableCard`. We discourage the use of any focusable elements within interactable Cards.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled Card

Interactable cards can have disabled styling applied by setting `disabled={true}`.

Make sure to as well apply `disabled={true}` to any nested components, such as Text, to ensure disabled styling is also applied to the inner content.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable-disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Multiple Cards

Layout components can be used for grouping Card components together.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--cards-in-grid-layout" />
</Canvas>
