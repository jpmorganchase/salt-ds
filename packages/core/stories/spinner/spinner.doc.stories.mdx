# Spinner

A Spinner is a visual representation of a process that's taking an indeterminate time to complete. Spinners can be triggered by automated system processes, user actions, or to indicate that content is loading. Spinners reassure the user that the system is still working, especially when the operation is taking longer than 300ms.

### Best practice

Improve accessibility by customizing the `aria-label` to provide additional context about what is loading, for example, `aria-label="loading settings panel"`.

## Default

Spinners have two sizes, `default` and `large`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-spinner--default" />
</Canvas>

## Large

Set the `size` prop to `"large"` to use the large Spinner.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-spinner--large" />
</Canvas>
