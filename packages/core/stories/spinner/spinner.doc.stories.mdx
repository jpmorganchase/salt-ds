# Spinner

A Spinner is a visual representation of a process that is taking an indeterminate time to complete. This can be triggered by automated system processes, user action, or to indicate that content is loading. This reassures the user that the system is still working, especially when the operation is taking longer than 1s.

### Best practice

Improve accessibility by customizing the `aria-label` to provide additional context about what is loading, for example, `aria-label="loading settings panel"`.

## Default

Spinners have two sizes, `default` and `large`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-spinner--default" />
</Canvas>

## Large

Set the `size` prop to `"large"` to use the large Spinner.

Large Spinners can be beneficial for full screen loading experiences; while default Spinners can be reserved for widget loading experiences.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-spinner--large" />
</Canvas>

## Loading

Center Spinner horizontally and vertically over a page or content that is loading if it takes between 1-9 seconds.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-spinner--loading" />
</Canvas>

## Partial Loading

If only a portion of a page is being updated, place the Spinner component in that part of the page.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-spinner--partial-loading" />
</Canvas>

## Usage

### When to use Spinner

- To indicate that content is loading.
- To reassure the user that the system is still working.
- For full screen and widget loading experiences.
- Although Spinner is reserved for indeterminate loading experiences, we also recommend it for actions you expect will take between 1-9 seconds. For actions that will run for a determinable length of time and which you think could take 10 seconds or more, we recommend you use the Progress component.

### Do

- Use for actions that you expect will take between 1-9 seconds to load or where it is not possible to determine the length of time remaining.
- Center Spinner horizontally and vertically over a page or content that is loading.
- If only a portion of a page is being updates, place the Spinner in that part of the page.

### Don't

- Don't use for actions that will run for a determinable length of time. Use Progress component instead.
- Don't use for actions which you think could take 10 seconds or more. Use Progress component instead.
