# Toolkit Provider

The UI Toolkit `ToolkitProvider` is a multi-purpose React Context provider. It allows values for cross-cutting concerns like `Theme` and `Density`
to be injected into an application. This will commonly be done at the root level of an application, making these values available throughout the
application. ToolkitProviders can also be nested to effect local overrides. Note that because almost all styling effects related to theme and density
are managed using CSS variables, it will very rarely be necessary for React components to access the theme or density directly. The main purpose of
these providers is to inject the appropriate CSS classes into the page so that the CSS variables which apply theme and density values are scoped correctly.

`ToolkitProvider` currently supports the following features:

- Theme
- Density
- Breakpoints
- AriaAnnouncer

## API

```js static
import { ToolkitProvider } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props

<ArgsTable of={ToolkitProvider} />

## Theme

You can use the `theme` prop to change the default theme (set to `uitk-theme`) by passing a theme name. For more details on Theme please go to <a href="?path=/story/documentation-styles-and-theming-introduction--page">Styles and Theming</a>

### useTheme

You can use the `useTheme` hook to access the value which indicates which theme and mode are currently active. The `useTheme` hook returns an object which contains string values of the currently set theme and mode in scope. You can optionally override these values by providing theme name and mode strings to `ToolkitProvider` via the `theme` and `mode` props.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@salt-ds/core";

function MyComponent() {
  const { mode, theme } = useTheme();
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Current theme: {theme}</div>
      <div>Current mode: {mode === "light" ? "Light Mode" : "Dark Mode"}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Density

You can use the `density` prop to change the density on the wrapped component or app, which by default is set to `medium`.

### useDensity

You can use the `useDensity` hook to access the currently active density of your app in the provided scope. The `useDensity` hook returns the string value of the currently set density. The possible values are `touch`, `low`, `medium` and `high`. You can optionally override this value by passing your new value as the first parameter to the function.

```tsx
import { useDensity } from "@salt-ds/core";
import cx from "classnames";

function MyComponent() {
  const [override, setDensityOverride] = useState();
  const density = useDensity(override);
  return (
    <>
      <div
        className={cx("myComponent", {
          "myComponent--touch": density === "touch",
        })}
      >
        Hello World!
      </div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setOverride("touch");
        }}
      >
        Set Touch Density
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## <a name="breakpoints"></a>Breakpoints

The `breakpoints` prop on `ToolkitProvider` can be used to customize the CSS media queries that custom hooks like `useBreakpoints` and `useCurrentBreakpoint` are using internally. These hooks are usually used to enable the responsive props, where you can pass multiple values (one per breakpoint) or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes. These props can mostly be found in the layout components for now. Refer to the [FlexLayout](/docs/documentation-core-layout-flexlayout--page) component documentation for a good example of this.

The default value is the following breakpoint size mapping object.

```js
{
  xs: 0,
  sm: 600,
  md: 960,
  lg: 1280,
  xl: 1920,
}
```

### useBreakpoints

You can use the `useBreakpoints` hook to access the current value of `breakpoints` in the `ToolkitProvider` context. This is a low-level hook that is used internally in other hooks such as `useResponsiveProp`. You can read more about this in the [breakpoints section](#breakpoints).

```tsx
import { useBreakpoints } from "@salt-ds/core";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ToolkitProvider breakpoints={{ sm: 420, md: 620 }}>
      <MyComponent />
    </ToolkitProvider>
  );
}

function MyComponent() {
  const breakpoints = useBreakpoints();
  // here we can use useBreakpoints to access the value from the ToolkitProvider prop
  return <div>Breakpoints: {breakpoints}</div>;
}
```

## AriaAnnouncer

`AriaAnnouncer` will be injected automatically inside the root element when `ToolkitProvider` is wrapping the app. If you use
nested ToolkitProviders, these will not inject further instances of `AriaAnnouncer`.

Read [AriaAnnouncer documentation](/docs/documentation-core-aria-announcer--page) for more details.

## Examples of ToolkitProvider use

Here is a `Card` including some very simple content and wrapped with a `ToolkitProvider`. We set the `ToolkitProvider` to use the light mode and high density.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Simple ToolkitProvider - Touch Density">
    <ToolkitProvider density="high" mode="light">
      <Card>
        <div>
          <h1>This is Card</h1>
          <span>Using Nested DOM Elements</span>
        </div>
      </Card>
    </ToolkitProvider>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Here is another example of a `Card` containing an additional nested `Card`. The nested `Card` is also wrapped with a `ToolkitProvider`, this time configured to use dark mode. Density is not specified on the inner `ToolkitProvider`, so is inherited from the outer instance.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Nested ToolkitProvider">
    <NestedProviders />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

By default, the `ToolkitProvider` wraps nested content with a `div` element to which the theme and density CSS classes are added.
Given the following JSX:

```jsx
<ToolkitProvider mode="light" density="medium">
  <Card>...</Card>
</ToolkitProvider>
```

then we would see the following HTML:

```html
<div class="uitk-theme uitk-density-medium" data-mode="light">
  <div class="uitkCard">...</div>
</div>
```

The `div` element is styled with `display: contents` using the class `uitk-theme` which generally ensures that it does not break any layout or formatting style rules that may be in effect. Child elements are styled and laid out as though the containing `div` element were not present.

Some browser implementations of `display: contents` are buggy (Safari, for example). Further, your code may rely on CSS query selectors in JavaScript that might be broken if they do not anticipate the additional `div` element inserted by the ToolkitProvider.

If you are concerned about either of these scenarios, the `ToolkitProvider` can be configured to not inject this additional element.
Instead it can add the required CSS classes to the child element nested within the Provider. You may also simply prefer this approach.

There is (currently) one limitation to this pattern, you must only use a single child element. This is enforced within the code and, for TypeScript users, via the typings. This would look as follows:

```jsx
<ToolkitProvider mode="light" density="medium" applyClassesTo="child">
  <Card>...</Card>
</ToolkitProvider>
```

Then we would see the following HTML.

```html
<div class="uitkCard uitk-theme uitk-density-medium" data-mode="light">...</div>
```

The `ToolkitProvider` can also be configured to add the required CSS classes to the root HTML element. This would allow you to apply styles to the whole of the document. Some use cases for this would be to prevent overscroll or to apply styling to the whole background of the page.

This would look as follows:

```jsx
<ToolkitProvider mode="light" density="high" applyClassesTo={"root"}>
  <Card>...</Card>
</ToolkitProvider>
```

Then we would see the following HTML.

```html
<html class="uitk-theme uitk-density-high" data-mode="light" lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      <div class="uitkCard">...</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

By default, the root level `ToolkitProvider` will apply the theme class, density class and the theme mode data attribute to the `<html>` element.
Nested `ToolkitProvider`s will create a div with the `uitk-provider` class where the classes and data attributes are added.
If you want the root level `ToolkitProvider` to create a div instead, you can set `applyClassesTo` to `"scope"`.

This would look as follows:

```jsx
<ToolkitProvider mode="light" density="high" applyClassesTo={"scope"}>
  <Card>...</Card>
</ToolkitProvider>
```

Then we would see the following HTML.

```html
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root">
      <div class="uitk-provider uitk-theme uitk-density-high" data-mode="light">
        <div class="uitkCard">...</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
