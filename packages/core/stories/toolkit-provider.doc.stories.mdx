# Toolkit Provider

The UI Toolkit `ToolkitProvider` is a multi-purpose React Context provider. It allows values for cross-cutting concerns like `Theme` and `Density`
to be injected into an application. This will commonly be done at the root level of an application, making these values are available throughout the
application. ToolkitProviders can also be nested to effect local overrides. Note that because almost all styling effects related to theme and density
are managed using CSS variables, it will very rarely be necessary for React components to access the theme or density directly. The main purpose of
these providers is to inject the appropriate CSS classes into the page so that the CSS variables which apply theme and density values are scoped correctly.

`ToolkitProvider` currently supports the following features:

- Theme
- Density
- AriaAnnouncer

Here is a `Card` including some very simple content and wrapped with a ToolkitProvider. We set the ToolkitProvider to use the toolkit
light theme and high density.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Simple ToolkitProvider - Touch Density">
    <ToolkitProvider density="high" theme="light">
      <Card>
        <div>
          <h1>This is Card</h1>
          <span>Using Nested DOM Elements</span>
        </div>
      </Card>
    </ToolkitProvider>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

The same `Card` containing an additional nested `Card`. The nested `Card` is also wrapped with a ToolkitProvider, this time configured to use
the toolkit dark theme. Density is not specified on the inner ToolkitProvider, so is inherited from the outer instance.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Nested ToolkitProvider">
    <NestedProviders />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

By default, the `ToolkitProvider` wraps nested content with a `div` element to which the theme and density CSS classes are added.
Given this JSX

```jsx
<ToolkitProvider theme="light" density="medium">
  <Card>...</Card>
</ToolkitProvider>
```

then we would see the following HTML.

```html
<div class="utik-theme uitk-theme-light uitk-density-medium">
  <div class="uitkCard">...</div>
</div>
```

The `div` element is styled with `display: contents` using the class `uitk-theme` which generally ensures that it does not break any layout or formatting
style rules that may be in effect. Child elements are styled and laid out as though the containing `div` element were not present.
Some browser implementations of `display: contents` are buggy (Safari, for example). Further, your code may rely on CSS query selectors
in JavaScript that might be broken if they do not anticipate the additional `div` element inserted by the ToolkitProvider.
If you are concerned about either of these scenarios, the `ToolkitProvider` can be configured to not inject this additional element.
Instead it can add the required CSS classes to the child element nested within the Provider. You may also simply prefer this approach.
There is (currently) one limitation to this pattern, you must use a single child element only. This is enforced within the code and,
for TypeScript users, via the typings.This would look as follows.

```jsx
<ToolkitProvider theme="light" density="dark" applyClassesToChild>
  <Card>...</Card>
</ToolkitProvider>
```

Then we would see the following HTML.

```html
<div class="uitkCard uitk-light uitk-density-medium">...</div>
```

#### AriaAnnouncer

None of the examples above mention `AriaAnnouncer`. The output it creates in markup is ignored for the sake of simplicity.
It requires no configuration, but is included in your app when you use a ToolkitProvider. Because only one instance of
AriaAnnouncer is ever required, only the outermost instance of ToolkitProvider will instantiate the AriaAnnouncer. If you use
nested ToolkitProviders, these will not inject further instances of AriaAnnouncer.

## Breakpoints

The `breakpoints` prop on ToolkitProvider can be used to customize the css media queries that custom hooks like `useBreakpoints` and `useCurrentBreakpoint` are using internally. These hooks are usually used to enable the responsive props, where you can pass multiple values (one per breakpoint) or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes. These props can mostly be found in the layout components for now. Look for an example in the [FlexLayout](/docs/documentation-core-layout-flexlayout--page) component documentation.

The default value is the following breakpoint size mapping object.

```js
{
  xs: 0,
  sm: 600,
  md: 960,
  lg: 1280,
  xl: 1920,
}
```

## useDensity

You can use `useDensity` hook to access the currently active density of your app in the provided scope. The useDensity hook returns the string value of the currently set density. The possible values are "touch", "low", "medium", and "high". You can optionally override the value by passing your own value as the first parameter to the function.

### API

```js
import { useDensity } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";
```

### Example use

```tsx
import { useDensity } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";
import cx from "classnames";

function MyComponent() {
  const [override, setDensityOverride] = useState();
  const density = useDensity(override);
  return (
    <>
      <div
        className={cx("myComponent", {
          "myComponent--touch": density === "touch",
        })}
      >
        Hello World!
      </div>
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          setOverride("touch");
        }}
      >
        Set Touch Density
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## useTheme

You can use the `useTheme` hook to access the value which indicates which themes are currently active. The `useTheme` hook returns the array value of the currently set themes in scope. The available themes by default are "uitk-light" and "uitk-dark". You can optionally override these values by providing an array of theme names to `ToolkitProvider` via the `themes` prop.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

function MyComponent() {
  const [currentTheme] = useTheme();
  return (
    <div>{currentTheme === "uitk-light" ? "Light Theme" : "Dark Theme"}</div>
  );
}
```

## useBreakpoints

You can use `useBreakpoints` hook to access the current value of `breakpoints` in the ToolkitProvider context. This is a low-level hook that is used internally in other hooks such as `useResponsiveProp`. You can read more about this in the breakpoints section.

```tsx
import { useBreakpoints } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <ToolkitProvider breakpoints={{ sm: 420, md: 620 }}>
      <MyComponent />
    </ToolkitProvider>
  );
}

function MyComponent() {
  const breakpoints = useBreakpoints();
  // here we can use useBreakpoints to access the value from the ToolkitProvider prop
  return <div>Hello World!</div>;
}
```

<!-- #### Portal

Note: `Portal` is not yet ready for release, the notes below are placeholder only. Need something to position the portal example

`Portal` is a Toolkit component that makes working with React Portals easy. Portals are useful where a popout, dropdown or dialog
needs to be rendered outside of the current HTML DOM tree. This is done to avoid Z-indexing and clipping issues that local element
structures might impose. Portal renders contents directly into the document body, employing CSS to manage positioning. This has
implications for styling. Because CSS Variables operate an inheritance model, a portal-rendered element which sits
outside the root <`div>` node wil be outside the scope of the theme variables. Therefore Portal always wraps rendered content
with a local ToolkitProvider which echoes the current theme values in effect at the point whetre the Portal is launched. This is easier
shown than explained.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Portal">
    <ToolkitProvider density="touch">
      <Button variant="cta">CTA</Button>
      <Button variant="primary">Primary</Button>
      <Portal>
        <Button variant="secondary">Secondary</Button>
      </Portal>
    </ToolkitProvider>
  </Story>
</Canvas> -->
