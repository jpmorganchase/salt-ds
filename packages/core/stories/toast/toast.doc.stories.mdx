# Toast

Toast displays a small pop-up notification that provides short feedback and disappears quickly. It is displayed in response to a user action or system event that relates to a workflow or application outside the user’s current focus.

## Examples

### Toast status

#### Info

Display an informational status message

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-toast--info" />
</Canvas>

#### Error

Signify a system error

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-toast--error" />
</Canvas>

#### Warning

Signify a system alert

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-toast--warning" />
</Canvas>

#### Success

Signify the successful completion of a system or user action

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-toast--success" />
</Canvas>

### Placement and multiple toasts

We advise using [Toast Group](?path=/story/lab-toast-group--bottom-right) from `lab` when you have multiple toasts and/or need to position them.

## When to use Toast

- Use Toast to notify users of an event that’s occurred in a peripheral application or workflow. A toast should be noticeable without disrupting the user’s experience or requiring immediate action.

- Toasts are generally low priority and caused by events. They usually don’t require feedback from the user.

- They should relate to a workflow external to the user’s current task or view, and are located in an unintrusive location on an interface.

- System generated alerts, independent of the user’s actions, are persistent and must allow the user to either take action or dismiss it. Toasts can contain customisable content such as actionable buttons.

- Position Toast where it won’t interfere with navigation or important content in the user interface, for example in the lower right corner of the screen or application viewport.

- Stack Toasts in chronological order if multiple Toasts need to appear on screen at the same time.

  - When Toasts are stacked from the top, the newest one should be on top. When they’re stacked from the bottom, the newest Toast should be at the bottom.

## When not to use Toast

- To show a notification that applies to the user’s current task, consider using Banner instead of Toast. Banner sits either on the top of a page or component, or inline, and usually addresses issues inside the user’s current content area.

- If the notification requires immediate action and is related to the user’s current task, consider using Dialog to interrupt their workflow.

## Content

Toast can be customised to contain custom content such as actionable components (e.g. buttons). This allows the user to act on the message where appropriate, e.g. if toast is tied to a level of urgency when displaying a warning or error alert. Toast should always have the option to be dismissed or closed by the user.

Custom content should be kept relatively short and concise where possible. If the custom content or action within the toast is important enough to interrupt the user’s current task, consider using a Dialog instead.

## Accessibility

Toast is accessible by assistive technologies like screen readers, and provides full WAI-ARIA support.

Content that contains any focusable elements will receive focus before the close button in toast. For example, if Toast contains a link inline to some content, the link receives focus first when the user tabs into toast. Tab again to move focus to the close button.
