# Card

A Card is a sheet of material that serves as an entry point to more detailed information. It is a convenient means of displaying content composed of different elements whose size or supported actions vary.

## Card Component

Card components have two levels of emphasis; medium (default) and high.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Card" decorators={[withFlexGap]}>
    <Card>
      <div>
        <h1>This is Card</h1>
        <span>Using Nested DOM Elements</span>
      </div>
    </Card>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## --uitkCard CSS Custom Property API

The default styling values for most Card attributes are provided by the theme variables. A smaller number of attributes
use hard-coded values local to Card. Both of these can be overridden, see Theme documentation for detailed usage guidance.

The CSS custom properties below are consumed by Card, but not defined by Card. They can be defined via a container or
a custom class name to override card styling. They will always take precedence over default styles, whether from theme variable
or declared locally. Again, see Theme documentation for guidance on when to use variables from the Custom Property API.
