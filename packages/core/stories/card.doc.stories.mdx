# Card

A Card is a sheet of material that serves as an entry point to more detailed information. It is a convenient means of displaying content composed of different elements whose size or supported actions vary.

## Card Component

This default example is intended to show the way the Card componentâ€™s content can be implemented.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--default" />
</Canvas>

## Interactable

Cards can have interactable styling by setting `interactable={true}`. These cards could be wrapped in Link, for example, for interactivity.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

Cards can have disabled styling applied by setting `disabled={true}`.

Make sure to as well apply `disabled={true}` to any nested components, such as Text, to ensure disabled styling is also applied to the inner content. We discourage the use of links within interactable Cards that can be disabled, since Salt Links cannot be disabled out of the box as they present usability issues, and create misleading interactions within an application.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--disabled" />
</Canvas>
