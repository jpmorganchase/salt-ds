# Card

A Card is a sheet of material that serves as an entry point to more detailed information. It is a convenient means of displaying content composed of different elements whose size or supported actions vary.

## Card Component

This default example is intended to show the way the Card componentâ€™s content can be implemented.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--default" />

Cards can have interactable styling by setting `interactable={true}`. These cards could be wrapped in Link, for example, for interactivity.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-card--interactable" />
