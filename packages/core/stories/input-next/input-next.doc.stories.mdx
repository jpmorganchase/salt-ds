# Input

Input provides an editable field in which users can enter arbitrary text and numeric values.

# Examples

## Default

Input comprises value text and a focus ring. The component is initially empty and then, once it has focus, it accepts text on a single line only.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input---default" />
</Canvas>

## Controlled

You can control Input with the `value` and `onChange` props. Learn more about <Link href="https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components">controlled vs uncontrolled components in the official React docs</Link>.

# Input Next

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input-next--controlled" />
</Canvas>

  <Story id="core-input---variants" />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

=======

  <Story id="lab-input-next--variants" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

> > > > > > > origin/main:packages/lab/stories/input-next/input-next.doc.stories.mdx

You can set Input to a disabled state, with no resultant action when the user interacts with it.

<Canvas>

  <Story id="core-input---disabled" />
</Canvas>

## Readonly

=======

  <Story id="lab-input-next--disabled" />
</Canvas>

### Read-only

> > > > > > > origin/main:packages/lab/stories/input-next/input-next.doc.stories.mdx

You can set Input to a read-only state. The value text can’t be edited in this state, but it can be highlighted and copied.

<Canvas>
<<<<<<< HEAD:packages/core/stories/input-next/input-next.doc.stories.mdx
  <Story id="core-input---readonly" />
</Canvas>

For accessibility purposes, it is recommended that you add a marker for empty read only fields via the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input—--empty-readonly-marker" />
</Canvas>

## Text Alignment

Text alignment is left by default. This can be changed via the `textAlign` prop to “center” or “right”.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-input—--text-alignment" />
</Canvas>

## Validation

=======

  <Story id="lab-input-next--readonly" />
</Canvas>

For accessibility purposes, we recommend that you add a marker for empty read-only fields via the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input—next--empty-readonly-marker" />
</Canvas>

### Text Alignment

Text is aligned to the left by default. Use the `textAlign` prop to change to “center” or “right”.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="lab-input—next--text-alignment" />
</Canvas>

### Validation

> > > > > > > origin/main:packages/lab/stories/input-next/input-next.doc.stories.mdx

Input can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

<Canvas>
<<<<<<< HEAD:packages/core/stories/input-next/input-next.doc.stories.mdx
  <Story id="core-input---validation" />
</Canvas>

- Use the error state to alert the user of a critical issue that’s related to the input. This issue, which may jeopardize completion of the task, usually requires action from the user to resolve the error.
- Display the warning state when you need to alert the user of a potential issue—that won’t prevent the user from continuing with the task, but may cause errors if it’s not addressed.

# API

```
import { Input } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props
