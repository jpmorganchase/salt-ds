# Multiline Input

Multiline Input provides an editable text area in which users can enter multiple lines of text and numeric values.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--default" />
</Canvas>

## Examples

### Default

Multiline Input comprises value text and a focus ring. The component is initially empty. Once it has focus, it accepts text on multipline lines, with a default of three lines visible to the user.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--default" />
</Canvas>

### Controlled

You can control Multiline Input with the `value` and `onChange` props. Learn more about <Link href="https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components#controlled-and-uncontrolled-components">controlled vs. uncontrolled components</Link> in the official React docs.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--controlled" />
</Canvas>

## Number of Rows

Multiline Input shows 3 rows by default. This can be adjusted by setting the `rows` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--number-of-rows" />
</Canvas>

## Bordered

Multiline Input can be styled with a full border by setting the `bordered` prop to `true`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--bordered" />
</Canvas>

### Variants

Multiline Input has two variants: primary (default) and secondary.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--variants" />
</Canvas>

### Disabled

You can set Multiline Input to a disabled state, with no resultant action when the user interacts with it.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--disabled" />
</Canvas>

- When setting Multiline Input to disabled state, ensure to also disable any nested interactive adornments, such as buttons.

### Placeholder

You can use a placeholder to prompt user input if no default value is provided.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--placeholder" />
</Canvas>

### Read-only

You can set Multiline Input to a read-only state. The value text can’t be edited in this state, but it can be highlighted and copied.
**Note:** Read-only fields are not focusable since they are treated as a static representation rather than a form control.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--readonly" />
</Canvas>

- When setting Multiline Input to read-only state, ensure to also disable any nested interactive adornments, such as buttons.

### Validation

Multiline Input can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--validation-states" />
</Canvas>

- Use the error state to alert the user of a critical issue that’s related to the input. Issues highlighted by an error state may jeopardize completion of the task and usually require action from the user to resolve the error.
- Display the warning state to alert the user of a potential issue that won’t prevent the user from continuing with the task, but may cause errors if it’s not addressed.

### Adornments

Adornments can be added at the beginning or end of the text area using the `startAdornment` and `endAdornment` props respectively. Use the `Button` component to have an interactive button within your Multiline Input.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--with-adornments" />
</Canvas>

### Character Count

Use a controlled Multiline Input to enforce a character count on the user input. Add the character count as a Label component to present the remaining characters out of the given limit.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--character-count" />
</Canvas>

- If the user goes over the character count limit, display an error state and change the Label to `primary` variant with strong text.

## Spellcheck

Automatic spellchecking can be turned on by using `inputProps`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-multiline-input--spellcheck" />
</Canvas>
