# Banner

The Banner component lets your users know about an error, warning, a successfully completed process or an information update. The banner should relate to the current workflow
and span the page or container horizontally to give quick and non-disruptive feedback.

## How you can use Banner

The Banner itself is only a presentational component, it does not provide the logic for deciding whether to render
or not. You will need to provide state management for deciding when to render a Banner.

You should always position the Banner component in the main content area, directly below
the navigation or in the related container component.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-banner--default" />
</Canvas>

## Banner Status

Banner contains four statuses `info`, `warning`, `error` and `success`. If not specified, the default value is `info`.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-banner--statuses" />
</Canvas>

If you need to share multiple notifications of the same state with your users, you should summarize them in a single Banner

If you have multiple notifications of different states, you should stack the respective banners from top to bottom,
in the following order: Information, Error, Warning, Success.

## Emphasized

You can make the banner more prominent by passing `emphasize={true}` which will apply a background to the component, as seen in the examples below:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-banner--emphasized" />
</Canvas>

## Dismissible

By default, the Banner is non-dismissible, If you want to make the Banner dismissible, then you should display the Banner conditionally and add the BannerCloseButton component with an onClick handler that will update the conditional param.

```js
const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
const onClose = () => {
  setOpen(false);
};

return (
  <>
    {open && (
      <Banner>
        <BannerContent>Dismissible banner.</BannerContent>
        <BannerCloseButton onClick={onClose} />
      </Banner>
    )}
  </>
);
```

<Canvas>
  <Story id="core-banner--controlled" />
</Canvas>

You should configure Banner to close when:

- The user performs an action that fixes an issue, for example they correct a validation error.
- The system status that triggered the notification is resolved, for example, a server connection is restored

## When to use Banner features

### Displaying general information

You should use the information Banner to draw attention to something your user may be unaware of; for example a link to updated terms and conditions.

<Canvas>
  <Banner>
    <BannerContent>
      There has been an update to the terms and conditions{" "}
      <Link href="#">link</Link>
    </BannerContent>
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

### Letting users know about an issue

If your users have a problem that prevents them from completing a task, such as a system error
or technical failure, use the error Banner to tell them how to resolve it.

<Canvas>
  <Banner status="error">
    <BannerContent>
      Action failed <Link href="#">link</Link>
    </BannerContent>
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

Use the warning Banner to let users know about an issue that won't prevent them from
continuing the task, but may cause errors if it's not addressed, such as a restriction due to entitlements
or current system status.

<Canvas>
  <Banner status="warning">
    <BannerContent>
      System is under increased load <Link href="#">link</Link>
    </BannerContent>
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

### Reassuring your users

Use the success Banner to reassure your users that an event or process related to the user's current
task has been successfully completed.

<Canvas>
  <Banner status="success">
    <BannerContent>
      Database updated <Link href="#">link</Link>
    </BannerContent>
  </Banner>
</Canvas>

## Configuring Banner

## Accessibility

Banner is accessible by assistive technologies like screen readers, and provides full WAI-ARIA support.

By default, Banner's content is spoken by screen readers. If you want screen readers to read the
surrounding page content instead, we recommend you turn this feature off with the `disableAnnouncer`
prop.

The following keyboard interaction applies to the Banner component:

| Key                                  | Function                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> | If focus is on the "X" button, activates the button and closes the Banner |
