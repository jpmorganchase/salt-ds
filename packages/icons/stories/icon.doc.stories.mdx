# Icon

Icon is an important visual representation of an application, a capability, or some other concept or specific entity with meaning on a interface. It is expected to help user to recognize and understand a content or an action regardless languages or culture boundaries.
We have 3 sizes of icon set for users to choose in terms of different platforms or device size.

If an icon is interactive, use [Button](?path=/docs/documentation-core-button--button-variants) (`CTA`, `Primary` or `Secondary` variant).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="icons-icon--toolkit-icon" />
</Canvas>

## Use Icon when...
- You need a visual representation of a concept.
- An icon doesn't need to be interactive.

## Accessibility

To ensure that icon-only buttons are ADA compliant, you must do the following:

- Display the buttonâ€™s label in a supporting Tooltip that is revealed on mouse hover or keyboard focus
- If an icon is interactive, use [Button](?path=/docs/documentation-core-button--button-variants) (`CTA`, `Primary` or `Secondary` variant).
