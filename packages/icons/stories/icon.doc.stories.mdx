# Icon

Icon is an important visual representation of an application, a capability, or some other concept or specific entity with meaning on a interface. It is expected to help user to recognize and understand a content or an action regardless languages or culture boundaries.

If an icon is interactive, use [Button](?path=/docs/documentation-core-button--button-variants) (`CTA`, `Primary` or `Secondary` variant).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="icons-icon--toolkit-icon" />
</Canvas>

## Use Icon when...

- You need a visual representation of a concept.
- An icon doesn't need to be interactive.

## Features

We have default icon set that starts from 12px for HD & MD, then 14px for LD, 16px for TD. (Since our base size of HD/default is 10px, but we don’t allowing icon size that is smaller then 12px, hence why here, the HD/default will start from 12px, and its 2X is 20px, 3X is 30px etc.)
Have more size choices by adding multiplies to 2x, 3x, 4x etc.

To ensure that icon-only buttons are ADA compliant, when icon is inside a button you must display the button’s label in a supporting Tooltip that is revealed on mouse hover or keyboard focus.
All the icon should be read out by screen-reader automatically with Aria label.
