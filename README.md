Salt provides you with a suite of UI components and a flexible theming system. With no customisation, the default theme offers an attractive and modern look-and-feel, with both light and dark variants and support for a range of UI densities.
We have included a theming system which allows you to easily create theme variations, or in fact substitute alternate themes.

Salt has been developed with the following design goals:

- Providing a comprehensive set of commonly-used UI controls.
- Complying with WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines.
- To be lightweight and performant.
- Offering flexible styling and theming support.
- Minimizing dependencies on third-party libraries.

## Installation

There are four packages you can install:

- `@salt-ds/core` is required, this contains stable components and receives
  new features and patch updates when needed.
- `@salt-ds/lab` is where we introduce new components which are under initial development until they are stable and moved over to core. This is typically an unstable environment and may have major breaking changes.
- `@salt-ds/theme` is required, this contains the Salt .css files required
  for any application you develop with Salt.
- `@salt-ds/icons` contains SVG-based icons you can use in your
  application.

Depending on the package manager you use, edit and run one of the following commands to install the packages you need:

```sh
npm install @salt-ds/core @salt-ds/theme @salt-ds/lab @salt-ds/icons
```

Or

```sh
yarn add @salt-ds/core @salt-ds/theme @salt-ds/lab @salt-ds/icons
```

You will then need to import the .css files into your application, along with any components that you plan to use.

Hereâ€™s a quick example of a Call-to-Action (CTA) button for your reference:

```JSX
import { Button, SaltProvider } from "@salt-ds/core";

import "@salt-ds/theme/index.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <SaltProvider>
      <Button variant="cta">CTA Button</Button>
    </SaltProvider>
  );
}
```
