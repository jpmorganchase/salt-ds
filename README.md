UITK provides you with a suite of UI components and a flexible theming system. With no customisation, the default theme offers an attractive and modern look-and-feel, with both light and dark variants and support for a range of UI densities.
We have included a theming system which allows you to easily create theme variations, or in fact substitute alternate themes.

The UITK has been developed with the following design goals:

- Providing a comprehensive set of commonly-used UI controls
- Complying with WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines
- To be lightweight and performant
- Offering flexible styling and theming support
- Minimizing dependencies on third-party libraries

# Installation

There are four packages you can install:

- @jpmorganchase/uitk-core is required, this contains stable components and receives
  new features and patch updates when needed.
- @jpmorganchase/uitk-lab is where we introduce new components which are under initial development until they are stable and moved over to uitk-core. This is typically an unstable environment and may have major breaking changes.
- @jpmorganchase/uitk-theme is required, this contains the uitk css files required
  for any application you develop with uitk.
- @jpmorganchase/uitk-icons contains SVG-based icons you can use in your
  application.

Depending on the package manager you use, edit and run one of the following commands to install the packages you need:

```sh
npm install @jpmorganchase/uitk-core @jpmorganchase/uitk-theme @jpmorganchase/uitk-lab @jpmorganchase/uitk-icons
```

Or

```sh
yarn add @jpmorganchase/uitk-core @jpmorganchase/uitk-theme @jpmorganchase/uitk-lab @jpmorganchase/uitk-icons
```

You will then need to import the css files into your application, along with any components that you plan to use.

Hereâ€™s a quick example of a Call-to-Action (CTA) button for your reference:

```JSX
import { Button, ToolkitProvider } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

import "@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme/index.css";

function App() {
  return (
    <ToolkitProvider>
      <Button variant="cta">CTA Button</Button>
    </ToolkitProvider>
  );
}
```
