# How to use the component page MDX template

To add a new component page to the Salt website:

1. Copy the [`component-name/`](./component-name/) folder into the [`site/docs/components/` directory](../../site/docs/components/) and rename it to your component's name in kebab case. For example `form-field/`.
1. Fill in the `index.mdx` file's frontmatter (refer to the comments within that file for guidance)
1. Fill in the `usage.mdx`, `examples.mdx` and `accessibility.mdx` files (refer to the comments within that file for guidance)
