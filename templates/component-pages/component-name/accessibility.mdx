## Keyboard interactions

Where needed, a table of keyboard controls can be created as shown below (just
delete it, if not needed)

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

A description of what pressing the Tab key will do to this component.

Descriptions may contain _any_ **markdown** formatting!

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

A description of what pressing Shift and Tab at the same time will do.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space / Enter">

You can have as many Keyboard control blocks as you need.
