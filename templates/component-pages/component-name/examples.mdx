<LivePreview componentName="component-name" exampleName="ComponentExample" displayName="Component Example Title">

### Component example title

Brief description of this example.

The `displayName` prop's value is used to display the example's name in the list
view and should therefore match the heading within this section.

If you omit it, the `exampleName` will be displayed in the list for this example
(with spaces inserted, so "ComponentExample" would display as
"Component Example").

#### Best practices

See the readme for more details about this section. Delete if not applicable.
