<LivePreview componentName="component-name" exampleName="ComponentExample" title="Component Example Title">

Brief description of this example. The text should be copied from the
corresponding example in the content template's "Examples" section.

The `title` prop is optional. If you omit it, the `exampleName` will be used
as a title for this example (with spaces inserted, so "ComponentExample" would
display as "Component Example").
