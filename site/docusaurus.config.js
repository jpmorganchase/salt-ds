  tagline: `Salt is the J.P. Morgan design system, an open-source solution for building exceptional products and digital experiences in financial services and other industries. It offers you well-documented, accessibility-focused components as well as comprehensive design templates, style libraries and assets.

  In time, as a full-service solution, Salt will be the vehicle for digital delivery of a universal design language—with best-in-class business patterns, content and accessibility guides, tooling and adoption resources.`,
