Header block is a standardized header for container components and application regions, used to display various text elements depending on scenarios. Headings can also display accent and status to highlight messaging.

## When to use

Use this pattern to:

- Display a combination of headings, pre-headers and descriptions within container components such as [Dialog](/salt/components/dialog), [Drawer](/salt/components/drawer) and [Overlay](/salt/components/overlay). This can help provide clear context and purpose of a component or interaction within a UI.  
**Note:** some Salt components, such as Dialog and Overlay, have header block embedded in by default, across both code and figma.
- Maintain a visually consistent layout and presentation for headers, and establish visual hierarchy of headings with supplementary text across different components and content layouts.
- Display headings with status icons to communicate different statuses, depending on the context of the component the header block sits within.

## How to build

### Anatomy

The header block pattern comprises the following visual and text elements:

1. **Accent bar**: spans the height of, and brings attention, to the heading and supplementary text.
2. **Heading**: serves as the primary title of a content type.  
3. **Pre-header**: displayed above the main heading. Used to introduce a section or draw attention to important information, such as a grouping or step in a process.  
4. **Description**: displayed below the main heading as a secondary text element that provides additional information or context to the main title. Brief descriptions can be used to clarify the main title, or provide further details about the content of the design.
5. **Close button**: optional action for the user to dismiss a component or element.  
6. **Status icon**: visual indicator that communicates status.

### Layout

Header block can be configured to be displayed using three different sizes, each differentiated by the size of the padding and the heading type. We recommend using an appropriately sized header block, relative to the container element it is embedded within.

As a rule of thumb, a large container in Salt uses padding size of `--salt-spacing-300`, a medium container uses `--salt-spacing-200`, and a small container uses `--salt-spacing-100`. For example, the Dialog component uses `--salt-spacing-300` padding between elements, therefore embedding a header block also using `--salt-spacing-300` maintains a consistent layout and ensures all elements align as expected.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Header block with `--salt-spacing-100` padding does not contain an accent bar. We recommend using this header block size within components where visual emphasis is not important. Consider the available space for an accent bar, relative to the size of the component.
</ExampleContainer>

## Layout variations

A header block has a number of possible layout variations depending on the amount of information you want to communicate, the user workflow and the container it will sit in.

### With accent bar and all text elements

Display headings with an accent bar which draws attention to the heading, reinforces brand identity, and remains consistent with Salt Design Systemâ€™s theming options.


<Diagram
  src="/img/patterns/header-block/with-accent-bar-and-text.png"
  alt="Dialog with a header block using padding --salt-spacing-300"
  content="Dialog with a header block using padding --salt-spacing-300"
  border
/>

### With accent bar, heading and pre-header only

The dialog example demonstrates a step in a process as introduced by the pre-header and heading. A description is not necessary as the content of the dialog is sufficiently self-explanatory for the user to navigate and complete the form field instructions.

<Diagram
  src="/img/patterns/header-block/accent-bar-heading-preheader.png"
  alt="Dialog with a header block using heading and pre header only."
  content="Dialog with a header block using heading and pre header only."
  border
/>

### With accent bar, heading and description only

The drawer example uses a heading accompanied by a description that provides additional information on the status of the content. A contextual overview of the content is not required in the form of a pre-header, as the content itself indicates a summary of information.

### Small container

  ]}
  label="Show overlay content area"
  caption="Overlay with a header block using padding --salt-spacing-100"
/>

### Close button only
Display a close button if a container element needs to be dismissed via a close button.
<ImageSwitcher
  images={[
    { src: "/img/patterns/header-block/close-button-only.png", alt: "" },
    { src: "/img/patterns/header-block/close-button-only-spacing.png", alt: "" },
  ]}
  label="Show overlay content area"
  caption="Overlay with a header block using padding --salt-spacing-100, and close button on display only"
/>

### With status
Display headings with status icons to communicate different statuses, depending on the context of the component the header block sits within.

  alt="A header block with status."
  border
/>

## Overflow behaviour
If content within a container exceeds the available viewport height, a scrollbar should be used to allow users to access all the content without resizing a container.

Header block should be displayed with the secondary [Divider](/salt/components/divider) component spanning horizontally between the left and right edges of the container and shadow directly below it to visually signal content contained within a scrollable area.
