When searching through a list, a filter enables users to specify criteria and only show relevant options. This pattern introduces the expected filter behavior applied to Salt components where a list is used.

## When to use

Use filtering when you have a lengthy list that users have to scroll to view all available options. The pattern typically comprises input and list based components to use a string to filter items for quick selection.

List filtering is a common behavior found in:
* Combobox
* List builder
* Pivot table
* Tree builder

## Highlighted characters

When filtering, highlight matching characters in item labels that match the filter criteria. This tells a user why the filter returned a given item. This behavior facilitates quick selection, allowing users to avoid navigating directly into the list. Instead, they can simply type their query and press enter to select the matching item.

    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Make sure that the first letter in the filtered list is displayed in `--salt-text-body-strong` font weight.
</ExampleContainer>

### No matches

When there are no items matching the filter text, an explanatory message is displayed instead of the list.

    alt="An example of no matches in the list."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

### Filter logic 

You can implement bespoke logic for the filtering any list. The logic we recommend for a simple list of data include:

* Case-insensitive matching, i.e., Alabama, alabama, ALAbama, will all return the same result.
* Matching only the first character(s) of the beginning of any word in the item labels to the filter string.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/list-filtering/filter-logic.png"
    alt="An example of filter logic."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

  <ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Increase the number of characters required to filter the list if there are a large number of items and results are slow to load. You could, for example, fetch results on input of the first character but only display them on input of the third, to improve perceived performance.
</ExampleContainer>

## Asychronus loading

When filter matches take longer to be returned—for example in Combo box, when data needs to be fetched asynchronously from the server side—a loading message is displayed and Spinner can be displayed in the field.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/list-filtering/filter-loading.png"
    alt="An example of asychronus loading."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

    <ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Configure the input to cease loading if the user edits or removes filter text. The component will be able to respond right away, and users won’t have to wait for the previous filter to complete.
</ExampleContainer>
