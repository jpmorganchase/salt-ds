## When to use

Use filtering when you have a lengthy list that users have to scroll to view all available options. The pattern typically comprises input and list based components to use a string to filter items for quick selection.

List filtering is a common behavior found in:
* [`ComboBox`](/salt/components/combo-box)
* [List builder](/salt/patterns/list-builder)
* Pivot table
* Tree builder

## Filter logic 

When filtering results, we recommend:

* Case-insensitive matching, i.e., Alabama, alabama, ALAbama, will all return the same result.
* Matching only the first character(s) of the beginning of any word in the item labels to the filter string.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Increase the minimum number of characters required to filter the list if there are a large number of items and results are slow to load. You could, for example, fetch results on input of the first character but only display them on input of the third. This would improve perceived performance.
</GuidanceCallout>

## No matches

When there are no items matching the filter text, display an explanatory message instead of the list.

    alt="An example of no matches in the list."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
    caption="An example of no matches in the list."
  />

## Highlighted characters

When filtering, highlight matching characters in item labels that match the filter criteria. This tells a user why the filter returned a given item.

    alt="An example of filtering a list in a combo box."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
    caption="An example of filtering a list in a combo box."
  />

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Make sure that the text in the list that matches the filter string is displayed in `--salt-text-fontweight-strong` font weight.
</GuidanceCallout>

## Loading

When filter matches take longer to return, display a loading message and a [spinner](/salt/components/spinner) in the field. An example is when the system needs to fetch data from a server.
