Metric is a pattern that displays an important number value prominently. You can add indicators or labels to help provide context to the presented value.

  <Diagram

    alt="Two example metrics displaying positive and negative indicators."
    contentPosition="top"

  />

We provide design guidance for using Salt [`Icon`](/salt/components/icon), [`Link`](/salt/components/link), [`StackLayout`](/salt/components/stack-layout) and [`Text`](/salt/components/text) components to build the pattern. You can also find implementation examples in the [Storybook](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/story/patterns-metric--metric).

## When to use it

Use the pattern to give more prominence to a key measure. Metrics are often used as building blocks in dashboards. They effectively direct users to key information that may otherwise be lost within the content, particularly when multiple numerical values are displayed.

Multiple metrics can be included in your UI, and you can indicate hierarchy if necessary.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Consider placing Metric pattern higher up in your layout to further emphasize their importance.
  - Never leave the user guessing how to interpret your Metric. Make sure you provide enough context, and use subtitles and indicators if they’ll help minimize ambiguity.
  - Keep titles and values as short and concise as possible. Round or truncate values to significant figures, and use common abbreviations instead of spelling out words.
  - Avoid having more than five Metrics in single dashboard view. They may clutter your screen and overwhelm your user with too much information.

## How to build it

Metric is comprised of a single number value and a title and can be orientated vertically or horizontally.

Metric comes in three sizes—small, medium and large. This is achieved by changing the Metric’s value text style to display 1, display 2 or display 3. Those are available in both horizontal and vertical layouts.

  - Consider using the same orientation when displaying multiple Metrics, for greater visual consistency.
</ExampleContainer>

### Vertical Metric

By default, it's arranged vertically with the key value beneath the title.

#### Large

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/vertical-large.png"
    alt="Example showing large metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Medium

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/vertical-medium.png"
    alt="Example showing medium metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Small

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/vertical-small.png"
    alt="Example showing small metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

### Horizontal Metric

You can configure the Metric component to have a horizontal orientation, if that's more suitable for your layout. Make sure you adjust the margin if you are varying the sizes.

#### Large

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/horizontal-large.png"
    alt="Example showing large metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Medium

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/horizontal-medium.png"
    alt="Example showing medium metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Small

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/horizontal-small.png"
    alt="Example showing small metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />


### Subtitle and subvalue

In addition to the title, you can display a supporting subtitle and/or subvalue in the Metric pattern. This information can be used to provide more context, and improve users' comprehension of your Metric value and its impact.

Subtitles are always displayed directly beneath the title, while subvalues are beneath the key value.
  
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/subtitle.png"
    alt="Example showing metric with a subtitle and subvalue."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - To give more context about a Metric value such as whether it is positive or negative—consider including past data, average, threshold or target values, or comparable high or low values.
</ExampleContainer>

### Link

You can provide a link in the Metric's subtitle text, enabling users to navigate to another page with related information.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/link.png"
    alt="Example showing metric with a link."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

### Indicators

If the Metric value represents a change from a previous value, an arrow icon can be displayed as a strong visual indicator of the direction of change.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/indicators.png"
    alt="Example showing two metrics with positive and negative indicators."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />
