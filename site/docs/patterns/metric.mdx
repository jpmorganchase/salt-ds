Metric is a pattern that displays an important number value prominently. Indicators or labels can be added to help provide context to the presented value.

We provide design guidance for using Salt Icon, Link, Stack Layout and Text components to achieve the pattern. You can also find implementation examples in Storybook.

## When to use

Use the pattern to give more prominence to a key measure. Metrics are often used as building blocks in dashboards. They effectively direct users to key information that may otherwise be lost within the content, particularly when multiple numerical values are displayed.

Multiple metrics can be included in your UI, and you can indicate hierarchy if necessary.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Consider placing metric pattern higher up in your layout to further emphasize key metrics importance.
  - Never leave the user guessing how to interpret your metric. Make sure you provide enough context, and use subtitles and indicators if they’ll help minimize ambiguity.
  - Keep titles and values as short and concise as possible. Round or truncate values to significant figures, and use common abbreviations instead of spelling out words.
  - Avoid having more than five metrics in a single dashboard view to prevent overwhelming your user with too much information.

## How to build

### Anatomy

A single metric is typically comprised of:

1. **Metric value:** can either be numeric or a string.
2. **Subtitles and subvalues:** displays supporting information to improve the user’s understanding of a metric. Subtitles can link to related pages.
3. **Visual indicators:** communicates contextual information.

### Layout

- Use [`Text`](/salt/components/text) to create the metric.
- Use [`Stack Layout`](/salt/components/stack-layout) to orient a metric in either a vertical or horizontal format.
- [`Icon`](/salt/components/icon) to display visual indicators.
- [`Link`](/salt/components/link) as an action to navigate to additional information or pages from a metric.

<ImageSwitcher
  images={[
    {
      src: "/img/patterns/metric/metric-layout-vertical.png",
      alt: "Metric vertical layout",
    },
    {
      src: "/img/patterns/metric/metric-layout-horizontal.png",
      alt: "Metric horizontal layout",
    },
  ]}
  label="Show horizontal metric"
/>

Metric is available in three sizes—small, medium and large. Change the size of the metric by changing the value text style between display 1, display 2 or display 3.  Metric is available in both horizontal and vertical layouts.

See the vertical and horizontal examples below for individual spacing values.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
 Consider using the same orientation when displaying multiple metrics within a single view, for greater visual consistency. Do not mix vertical and horizontal metrics.
</ExampleContainer>

### Vertical metric

By default, metric is arranged vertically with the value positioned beneath the title.

#### Large

    alt="Example showing large metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Medium

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/vertical-metric-medium.png"
    alt="Example showing medium metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Small

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/vertical-metric-small.png"
    alt="Example showing small metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

### Horizontal metric

You can display the metric component in a horizontal orientation, if that's more suitable for your layout. Ensure the margin height is adjusted in line with the size of the metric.

#### Large

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/metric-spacing-large.png"
    alt="Example showing large metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Medium

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/metric-spacing-medium.png"
    alt="Example showing medium metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Small

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/metric-spacing-small.png"
    alt="Example showing small metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />


### Subtitle and subvalue

In addition to the title, you can display a supporting subtitle and/or subvalue within a metric. This information can be used to provide more context, and improve users' comprehension of a metric value and its impact.

Subtitles are always displayed directly beneath the title, while subvalues are beneath the key value.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/subtitle-and-subvalue.png"
    alt="Example showing a metric with a subtitle and subvalue."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  To give more context about a metric value such as whether it is positive or negative—consider using the subvalue to provide past data, average, threshold or target values, or comparable high or low values.
</ExampleContainer>

### Link

Display a link in the metric's subtitle text, enabling users to navigate to another page with related information.

Enable users to navigate to another page by linking from the subtitle.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/metric-link.png"
    alt="Example showing a metric with a link."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

### Indicators

Use indicators to provide further contextual information. For example, if the metric value represents a change from a previous value, i.e. from positive to negative, you can display an arrow icon as a strong visual indicator of the direction in change.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/metric-indicators.png"
    alt="Example showing two metrics with positive and negative indicators."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />
