Metric is a pattern that displays an important number value prominently. You can add indicators or labels to help provide context to the presented value.

  <Diagram

    alt="Two example metrics displaying positive and negative indicators."

We provide design guidance for using Salt [`Icon`](/salt/components/icon), [`Link`](/salt/components/link), [`StackLayout`](/salt/components/stack-layout) and [`Text`](/salt/components/text) components to build the pattern. You can also find implementation examples in the [Storybook](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/story/patterns-metric--metric).

## When to use it

Use the pattern to give more prominence to a key measure. Metrics are often used as building blocks in dashboards. They direct users to key information that they may otherwise overlook, particularly when multiple numerical values are displayed. Metrics can encompass a broad range of quantitative data, such as financial statistics, performance indicators and user engagement.

You can add multiple metrics to your UI, and you can use different sizes to indicate hierarchy when dealing with multiple metrics of varying importance.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Place metrics higher in your layout when you want to emphasize their importance.
  - Never leave the user guessing how to interpret a metric. Use subtitles and indicators to minimize ambiguity, such as a green arrow to indicate a positive change in a metric's value.
  - Keep titles and values as short and concise as possible. Round or truncate values to significant figures, and use common abbreviations instead of spelling out words.
  - Avoid displaying more than five metrics in a single dashboard view. This can clutter the user's screen and overwhelm them with too much information.

## How to build it

A metric is comprised of a single number value and a title. You can orient it vertically or horizontally.

Metric comes in three sizes—small, medium and large. This is achieved by changing the Metric’s value text style to display 1, display 2 or display 3. Those are available in both horizontal and vertical layouts.

### Vertical metric

By default, metrics are arranged vertically with the key value under the title.

#### Large

    alt="Example showing large metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Medium

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/vertical-medium.png"
    alt="Example showing medium metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Small

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/vertical-small.png"
    alt="Example showing small metric with vertical layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

### Horizontal metric

You can configure the metric to have a horizontal orientation if it's more suitable for your layout. Make sure you adjust the margin if you are varying the sizes.

#### Large

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/horizontal-large.png"
    alt="Example showing large metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Medium

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/horizontal-medium.png"
    alt="Example showing medium metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

#### Small

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/horizontal-small.png"
    alt="Example showing small metric with horizontal layout."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />


### Subtitle and subvalue

In addition to the title, you can display a supporting subtitle and/or subvalue in the metric pattern. You can use this to provide more context and improve users' comprehension of your metric value and its impact, such as whether it is positive or negative. Consider including past data, average, threshold or target values, or comparable high or low values.

Subtitles are always displayed directly beneath the title, while subvalues are beneath the key value.

    alt="Example showing metric with a subtitle and subvalue."
    contentPosition="top"

### Link

You can provide a link in the metric's subtitle text. This enables users to navigate to another page with related information.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/metric/link.png"
    alt="Example showing metric with a link."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

### Indicators

If the metric value represents a change from a previous value, you can display an arrow icon as a strong visual indicator of the direction of change.

    alt="Example showing two metrics with positive and negative indicators."
    contentPosition="top"
