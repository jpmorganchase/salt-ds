Button Bar is a pattern that displays possible actions for users to take when they reach the end of a task. You can use it to provide consistent design when implementing actionable interactions within pages or dialogs across your applications.

  <Diagram

    alt="Example button bar, with CTA to the left then primary, on the right side there are two secondary buttons"
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

We provide design guidance of how you can use Salt Button and Layout components and Button Bar template to achieve the pattern. Implementation examples can also be seen in the storybook.

## When to use it

Use the pattern when your user needs to do next actions when reaches the end of a task in a page or a dialog, such as: 
- navigating to previous or next steps, 
- submitting a form, 
- or cancelling changes. 

## How to build it

    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

## Button options 

There are three button variants to choose from. Choosing the correct button is dependent on the context and is ultimately the choice of the application team. However, we recommend following these guidelines for consistent design:

**Call to Action (CTA)**
- Use for the most desired path you are intending the user to take.
- In almost all cases, your scenario should have no less or no more than one CTA so the desired path is clear.
- This is commonly an affirmative action allowing users to proceed or complete the task, such as Continue, Save, Submit.

**Primary**
- Use for the alternate path you are offering the user.
- There can be multiple alternate paths that are equally weighted, resulting in more than one primary button in a scenario.
- Is also commonly used as a dismissive action alongside the affirmative (CTA) action, such as Cancel, Dismiss.

**Secondary**
- Use for the tertiary path you are offering the user.
- There can be multiple tertiary paths that are equally weighted, resulting in more than one secondary button on a scenario.
- Commonly a related task or function that’s lower priority for the task, such as Import, Export.
- Also used to signify a destructive action which may result in a permanent loss of data, which is commonly followed by user confirmation (e.g., a dialog), such as Delete, Reset.

Remember to use hierarchy when making your button choices, much like you would following a type ramp. In example one below, “Cancel” is the alternate path and uses a primary button because there are only two options. However, in example two, “Cancel” uses the secondary button because there are three actions available to the user, with this one being tertiary and the least desired option.

    alt="Example showing button bar with submit button on left as CTA, and cancel as primary to the right of submit"

    ### Example 1
    - Primary action “Submit” uses CTA button.
    - Alternate action “Cancel” uses primary button.
    </Diagram>
  <Diagram

    alt="Example showing button bar with next button on right as CTA, previous as primary to the left of next, and cancel as secondary to the left of cancel"
    contentPosition="top"
  >
    ### Example 2
    - Primary action “Next” uses CTA button.
    - Alternate action “Previous” uses primary button (order follows sequential forms).
    - Tertiary action “Cancel” uses secondary button.
  </Diagram>
</Diagrams>

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Provide only one CTA button for a given task—the action that allows the user to complete the task.

## Button order

The position of actions (CTA, primary, secondary buttons) is determined by the type of scenarios and the container.

<Diagrams>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/default-order.png"
    alt="Example showing default button bar order, submit CTA on the left and cancel primary to the right of submit"
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  >
    #### Default/Single-step form
    - Core actions are grouped on the left.
    - Follows an F-pattern reading model, to easily scan down the left edge through the content to the actions.
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/multi-step-form.png"
    alt="Example showing form with button bar underneath, the core actions are grouped on the right."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  >
    #### Multi-step form
    - Core actions are grouped on the right.
    - ‘Next’ always positioned right of ‘Previous’ and ‘Cancel’ to reflect the direction of the steps.
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/dialog.png"
    alt="Example showing a dialog with a form and button bar underneath, the core actions are grouped on the right."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
    #### Dialog
    - Core actions are always displayed on the right.
    - Follows a Z-pattern reading model, where actions are the last focal point in the dialog.
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/small-viewport.png"
    alt="Example showing a form with two buttons that fill the width"
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
    #### Small viewport
    In a small viewport (below the xs breakpoint), actions can fill the width for a cleaner layout if button width doesn’t need to drastically increase.
  </Diagram>
</Diagrams>

<ExampleContainer type="positive">
  - Core onward actions for the form are grouped together to ensure they remain accessible on browser zoom (e.g., Previous, Next, Cancel, or Submit, Cancel).
  - Secondary actions which aren’t core to the workflow should be displayed at the opposite end of the button bar.
</ExampleContainer>

## Button bar position

There are two ways to position the button bar:

### Fixed

The button bar is fixed at the bottom of the viewport when:
- A user can proceed (or step back) regardless of task completion.
- If content overflows, the button bar is displayed with a secondary border style.
- The task is in a wizard.

<Diagrams>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/fixed-left.png"
    alt="Example showing a form overflowing behind a button bar. The button bar has a top border."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
  When fields overflow behind the button bar, a border should indicate if more fields are available. 
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/fixed-right.png"
    alt="Example showing the end of a form. The button bar has no top border."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
  Hide the button bar border if content is no longer overflowing (i.e., user has reached the bottom of the form or the form is displayed entirely above the fold).
  </Diagram>
</Diagrams>

### In line

The button bar is displayed at the end of the task when:
- The user needs to complete the entire task before proceeding, for example, if there are mandatory fields in a form.
- The system needs the user to acknowledge all information on the page.

<Diagrams>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/in-line-left.png"
    alt="Example showing an overflowing form."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
  When the button bar is displayed at the end of the task, the button may not be shown when user is on the top of the task.
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/in-line-right.png"
    alt="Example showing the bottom of a form with buttons."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
  The button bar will be seen when user scroll to the bottom of the task.
  </Diagram>
</Diagrams>

## Button labels

Buttons can display text or icons (or both) to describe the action. 

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Always use verbs that emphasize the action that will be carried out.
  - Be succinct. Avoid having more than two or three words in a button label.
  - For example, use “Create” instead of “Ok” to Create a Profile, or “Save/Discard” instead of “Yes/No” to Save Changes.
</ExampleContainer>

## Stacked Button Bar layout

For improved usability at smaller screen or app resolutions, we recommend responsively stacking the Button Bar when it reaches a specific viewport width or application breakpoint. 

We recommend stacking at the xs breakpoint by default. Buttons will expand to fill the full width of the Button Bar when stacked.

**Order of stacked buttons**: In a stacked button layout, we recommend buttons stack in order of importance from the top down.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/stacked.png"
    alt="Example button bar, vertically stacked"
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Enable the stacked layout when you have longer button labels which may not fit within the horizontal layout at smaller Button Bar widths.
  - If your application will be used on a mobile device, use a stacked button layout to ensure an adequate touch-area for the buttons.
</ExampleContainer>
