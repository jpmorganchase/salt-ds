Button bar is a pattern that displays possible actions for users to take when they reach the end of a task. You can use it to provide consistent design when implementing actionable interactions within pages or dialogs across your applications.

We provide design guidance for using Salt [button](/salt/components/button) and layout components ([stack layout](/salt/components/stack-layout) and [split layout](/salt/components/split-layout)) to achieve the pattern. You can also find implementation examples in the [storybook](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/story/patterns-button-bar--button-bar).

## When to use it

Use the pattern when the user needs to perform actions after reaching the end of a task in a page or a dialog. Some examples include navigating to previous or next steps, submitting a form and canceling changes.

## How to build it

Core actions:
1. Use the stack layout component to group your buttons together. This will form the core set of actions. 
2. Ensure that the stack layout has the direction property set to row.

Secondary actions (optional):
1. If your design requires a secondary set of actions, use another stack layout with button components as above.
2. Combine the core and secondary stack layouts within a split layout to position them at the ends of the container.
    - Assign the left buttons to the split layout `startItem` property. 
    - Assign the right buttons to the split layout `endItem` property.

## Button options 

There are three button variants to choose from. Choosing the correct button depends on the context and is ultimately the choice of the application team. However, we recommend following these guidelines for consistent design:

**Call to Action (CTA)**
- Use for the most desired path you intend the user to take.
- In almost all cases, your scenario should have one CTA so the desired path is clear.
- This is commonly an affirmative action allowing users to proceed or complete the task, such as Continue, Save or Submit.

**Primary**
- Use for the alternate path you're offering the user.
- There can be multiple equally weighted paths, resulting in more than one primary button in a scenario.
- You can use it as a dismissive action alongside the affirmative (CTA) action, such as Cancel or Dismiss.

**Secondary**
- Use for the tertiary path you're offering the user.
- There can be multiple equally weighted tertiary paths resulting in more than one secondary button in a scenario.
- This is commonly a related task or function that’s lower priority for the task, such as Import or Export.
- You can also use it to signify a destructive action that may result in a permanent loss of data, commonly followed by user confirmation (e.g., a dialog), such as Delete or Reset.

Remember to use hierarchy when making your button choices, much like following a type ramp. In Example 1 below, Cancel is the alternate path and uses a primary button because there are only two options. However, in Example 2, Cancel uses the secondary button because three actions are available to the user, with this one being tertiary and the least desired option.

    ### Example 1
    - The **Submit** primary action uses the CTA button
    - The **Cancel** alternate action uses the primary button
    </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/ex-2.png"
    alt="Example showing button bar with next button on right as CTA, previous as primary to the left of next, and cancel as secondary to the left of cancel"
    contentPosition="top"
  >
    ### Example 2
    - The **Next** primary action uses the CTA button
    - The **Previous** alternate action uses the primary button (order follows sequential forms).
    - The **Cancel** tertiary action uses the secondary button.
  </Diagram>
</Diagrams>

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Provide only one CTA button for a given task—the action that allows the user to complete the task.

## Button order

The container and the type of scenario determine the position of actions (CTA, primary and secondary buttons).

<Diagrams>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/default-order.png"
    alt="Example showing default button bar order, submit CTA on the left and cancel primary to the right of submit"
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  >
    ### Default/Single-step form
    - Groups core actions on the left.
    - Follows an F-pattern reading model, allowing users to quickly scan down.
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/multi-step-form.png"
    alt="Example showing form with button bar underneath, the core actions are grouped on the right."
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  >
    ### Multi-step form
    - Groups core actions on the right
    - Always positions **Next** right of **Previous** and **Cancel** to reflect the direction of the steps
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/dialog.png"
    alt="Example showing a dialog with a form and button bar underneath, the core actions are grouped on the right."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
    ### Dialog
    - Always displayes core actions on the right.
    - Follows a Z-pattern reading model, where actions are the last focal point in the dialog.
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/small-viewport.png"
    alt="Example showing a form with two buttons that fill the width"
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
    ### Small viewport (below the xs breakpoint)
    - Provides the option for actions to fill the width for a cleaner layout if button width doesn’t need to increase drastically.
  </Diagram>
</Diagrams>

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Group core onward actions for the form to ensure they remain accessible on browser zoom (e.g., Previous, Next, Cancel, or Submit, Cancel).
  - You should display secondary actions that aren’t core to the workflow at the opposite end of the button bar.
</ExampleContainer>

## Button bar position

There are two ways to position the button bar:

### Fixed

The button bar is fixed at the bottom of the viewport when:
- A user can proceed (or step back) regardless of task completion.
- If content overflows, button bar has a secondary border style.
- The task is in a wizard.

<Diagrams>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/fixed-left.png"
    alt="Example showing a form overflowing behind a button bar. The button bar has a top border."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
  When fields overflow behind the button bar, a border should indicate if more fields are available. 
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/fixed-right.png"
    alt="Example showing the end of a form. The button bar has no top border."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
  Hide the button bar border if content is no longer overflowing (i.e., user has reached the bottom of the form or the form is displayed entirely above the fold).
  </Diagram>
</Diagrams>

### In line

The button bar is located at the end of the task when:
- The user needs to complete the entire task before proceeding, for example, if there are mandatory fields in a form.
- The system needs the user to acknowledge all information on the page.

<Diagrams>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/in-line-left.png"
    alt="Example showing an overflowing form."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
  When the button bar is at the end of the task, the button may not be visible when the user is at the top.
  </Diagram>
  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/in-line-right.png"
    alt="Example showing the bottom of a form with buttons."
    contentPosition="bottom"
    border
  >
  The button bar will be visible when the user scrolls to the bottom of the task.
  </Diagram>
</Diagrams>

## Button labels

Buttons can display text or icons (or both) to describe the action. 

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Always use verbs that emphasize the action the button will carry out.
  - Be succinct. Avoid having more than two or three words in a button label.
  - For example, use **Create** instead of **Ok** to create a profile, or **Save/Discard** instead of **Yes/No** to dave changes.
</ExampleContainer>

## Stacked button bar layout

For improved usability at smaller screen or app resolutions, we recommend responsively stacking the button bar when it reaches a specific viewport width or application breakpoint. 

We recommend stacking at the xs breakpoint by default. Buttons will expand to fill the full width of the Button Bar when stacked.

**Order of stacked buttons**: In a stacked button layout, we recommend buttons stack in order of importance from the top down.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/button-bar/stacked.png"
    alt="Example button bar, vertically stacked"
    contentPosition="top"
    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Enable the stacked layout when you have longer button labels that may not fit within the horizontal layout at smaller Button Bar widths.
  - If users will access your application on a mobile device, use a stacked button layout to ensure an adequate touch-area for the buttons.
</ExampleContainer>

### Building a stacked button bar

1. Build a button bar following the foundational guidelines provided earlier in the documentation.
2. Adjust the direction property on both stack layout and split layout (if utilized) to `{{xs: "column", sm: "row"}}`. This responsive setting arranges the buttons into a column for extra-small (xs) screens and a row for small (sm) screens and upwards, ensuring a responsive layout that adapts to the viewport width.
3. When the button bar has core actions on the right, you will need to configure an alternative stack layout.
    - Reverse the buttons in this layout to ensure the core actions are at the top.
    - Employ Salt's responsive design utilities to render this alternative layout at the desired breakpoint. You can find an example of this behaviour [here](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/story/patterns-button-bar--responsive-reverse).
