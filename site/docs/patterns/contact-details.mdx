Contact details display communication information for a person, company, distribution list or individual channel. This can include a name, a phone number or email address.

## When to use

Use this pattern to:
- Provide details and direct channels of communication for sales or support purposes.
- Display contact information in a directory or CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system.
- Allow users to populate form fields in a workflow with details from a list of contacts, e.g., client contact selection for a ticket.

## How to build

### Anatomy

The contact details pattern comprises an avatar and text elements:

1. **Avatar**: A visual representation of the contact that provides a point of reference at glance.
2. **Header**: Contains the name of the contact. Optionally, use text to display further information such as company names or company ID.
3. **Additional details**: Relevant meta data, e.g., role, location, phone number or email. You can define the details as links, making them interactive, to enable immediate communication to a contact from within your application.

    border
/>

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Keep label lengths similar to ensure close proximity to their respective values. If you’re displaying supplementary details, we recommend that you left align their labels.
</ExampleContainer>

### Layout

Use [`StackLayout`](/salt/components/stack-layout) to display the avatar and all text elements that make up contact details in a row.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-layout-1.png"
    alt="Contact Details with layout annotations"
    border
  />

Use `StackLayout` to display the additional details in a row.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-layout-2.png"
    alt="Contact Details with layout annotations"
    border
  />

Use `StackLayout` to display the header and additional details section in a column.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-layout-3.png"
    alt="Contact Details with layout annotations"
    border
  />

Use `StackLayout` to display the header and further information (if there is any) in a column.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-layout-4.png"
    alt="Contact Details with layout annotations"
    border
  />

Use `StackLayout` to display further information (if there is any) in a column.

 <Diagram

    alt="Contact Details with layout annotations"
    border
  />

## Using icons

You can use icon descriptors as a visually concise alternative to textual labels—to help users quickly identify the available communication channels.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-icons.png"
    alt="Contact Details using Icon Descriptors"
    caption="An example of contact details using descriptive icons."
    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Refrain from using icon descriptors when you have multiple values for similar channels, such as work and cellphone numbers.
</ExampleContainer>

## Using links

You can define contact details as links, making them interactive. This enables immediate communication to a contact from within your application.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-using-links.png"
    alt="Contact Details using Icon Descriptors"
    caption="An example of contact details using links."
    border
  />

## In a container

You can embed contact details in a range of container components. 

This example demonstrates the component embedded within a [card](/salt/components/card).

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-card.png"
    alt="Contact Details Embedded in a Card"
    caption="Contact details embedded within a card."
    border
  />


## Quick actions

You can define quick actions, one-click shortcuts to specific functions or features. This can include starting a new email in Outlook, or calling a contact in Zoom.

Ensure that quick action buttons have a tooltip displayed as per the [icon only button best practices](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/button/examples#icon-only).

For layout guidance, refer to the [button bar pattern](/salt/patterns/button-bar).

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-actions.png"
    alt="Contact Details with quick actions button bar"
    caption="Contact details with a quick actions button bar."
    border
  />

## Collapsible

If you’re displaying supplementary details, you can configure them to be collapsible.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-collapsible-spacing.png"
    alt="Contact Details with collapsible details"
    caption="Contact details with collapsible details."
    border
  />

   <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-collapsible-layout.png"
    alt="Collapsible detail layout"
    caption="Use a split layout between quick actions and the collapsible button."
    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Consider making supplementary details collapsible when they contain secondary information, and don’t need to be always on display.
</ExampleContainer>

## List version

The list version allows you to display a snapshot of key details. It’s ideal when you have restricted real estate, such as in a client picker dropdown menu or a contact directory list.

To show as many options as possible, we recommend you keep data points to no more than one line. Prioritize the most important values.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-list.png"
    alt="Contact Details in list"
    caption="Contact details in a list."
    border
  />

Use `StackLayout` to display the text elements underneath the header in a row.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-list-layout-1.png"
    alt="Contact Details in list using stack layout."
    border
  />

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-list-layout-2.png"
    alt="Contact Details in list using stack layout."
    border
  />
