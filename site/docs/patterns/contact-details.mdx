## When to use

Use this pattern to:
- Provide details and direct channels of communication for sales or support purposes.
- Display contact information in a directory or CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system.
- Allow users to populate form fields in a workflow with details from a list of contacts, e.g., client contact selection for a ticket.

## How to build

### Anatomy

The contact details pattern comprises an avatar and text elements:

1. **Avatar**: A visual representation of the contact that provides a point of reference at glance.
2. **Header**: Contains the name of the contact. Optionally, use text to display further information such as company names or company ID.
3. **Additional details**: Relevant meta data, e.g., role, location, phone number or email. You can define the details as links, making them interactive, to enable immediate communication to a contact from within your application.

    border
/>

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Keep label lengths similar to ensure close proximity to their respective values. If you’re displaying supplementary details, we recommend that you left align their labels.
</GuidanceCallout>

### Layout

Use [`StackLayout`](/salt/components/layouts/stack-layout) to display the avatar and all text elements that make up contact details in a row.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-layout-1.png"
    alt="Contact Details with layout annotations"
    border
  />

Use `StackLayout` to display the additional details in a row.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-layout-2.png"
    alt="Contact Details with layout annotations"
    border
  />

Use `StackLayout` to display the header and additional details section in a column.

 <Diagram

    alt="Contact Details with layout annotations"
    border
  />

## Using icons

You can use icon descriptors as a visually concise alternative to textual labels—to help users quickly identify the available communication channels.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-icons.png"
    alt="Contact Details using Icon Descriptors"
    caption="An example of contact details using descriptive icons."
    border
  />

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Refrain from using icon descriptors when you have multiple values for similar channels, such as work and cellphone numbers.
</GuidanceCallout>

## Using links

We recommend emails to be interactive links by default, you can also define other details (e.g. phone number) as links, making them interactive—to enable immediate communication to a contact from within your application.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-using-links.png"
    alt="Contact Details using links"
    caption="An example of contact details using links."
    border
  />

## In a container

You can embed contact details in a range of container components. 

This example demonstrates the component embedded within a [card](/salt/components/card).

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-card.png"
    alt="Contact Details Embedded in a Card"
    caption="Contact details embedded within a card."
    border
  />


## Quick actions

You can define quick actions, one-click shortcuts to specific functions or features. This can include starting a new email in Outlook, or calling a contact in Zoom.

Ensure that quick action buttons have a tooltip displayed as per the [icon only button best practices](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/button/examples#icon-only).

For layout guidance, refer to the [button bar pattern](/salt/patterns/button-bar).

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-actions.png"
    alt="Contact Details with quick actions button bar"
    caption="Contact details with a quick actions button bar."
    border
  />

## Collapsible

If you’re displaying supplementary details, you can configure them to be collapsible.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-collapsible-spacing.png"
    alt="Contact Details with collapsible details"
    caption="Contact details with collapsible details."
    border
  />

   <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-collapsible-layout.png"
    alt="Collapsible detail layout"
    caption="Use a split layout between quick actions and the collapsible button."
    border
  />

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
Consider making supplementary details collapsible when they contain secondary information, and don’t need to be always on display.
</GuidanceCallout>

## List version

The list version allows you to display a snapshot of key details. It’s ideal when you have restricted real estate, such as in a client picker dropdown menu or a contact directory list.

To show as many options as possible, we recommend you keep data points to no more than one line. Prioritize the most important values. 

The link function won't be able to be applied to the text content (e.g. email or phone number) as it is an list item that users select as a whole option from the dropdown.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-list.png"
    alt="Contact Details in list"
    caption="Contact details in a list."
    border
  />

Use `StackLayout` to display the text elements underneath the header in a row.

 <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/contact-details/contact-details-list-layout-1.png"
    alt="Contact Details in list using stack layout."
    border
  />

    alt="Contact Details in list using stack layout."
    border
  />
