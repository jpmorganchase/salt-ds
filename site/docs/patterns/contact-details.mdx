Contact Details is a pattern that displays communication information—for a person, company, distribution list or individual channel, such as a name, a phone number or email address.

We provide design guidance for using Salt [Avatar](/salt/components/avatar), [Button](/salt/components/button), [Icon](/salt/components/icon), [Text](/salt/components/text), [Tooltip](/salt/components/tooltip), [Stack Layout](/salt/components/stack-layout) and [Flow Layout](/salt/components/flow-layout) components to achieve the pattern. You can also find implementation examples in the [storybook](https://storybook.saltdesignsystem.com/?path=/story/patterns-contact-details--contact-details)

## When to use it

Use cases for this pattern could include:
- Provide details and direct channels of communication for sales or support purposes.
- Display contact information in a directory or CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system.
- Allow users to populate form fields in a workflow with details from a list of contacts, e.g. client contact selection for a ticket.

- Consider a Data Grid when you need to display a large number of contacts with a standardized set of contact information.
</ExampleContainer>

## How to build it

Contact Details is comprised of an avatar and text elements, a title can be used as a name of a contact or a company, optional details can be company names or company ID.
Any relevant meta data that you want to communicate can be displayed depending on the requirements of your applications. 

You can define the details as links, making them interactive, to enable immediate communication to a contact from within your application.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
- Keep label lengths similar, in order to ensure close proximity to their respective values. If you’re displaying supplementary details, we recommend that you left align their labels.

#### Using Stack Layout

#### Using Icons

You can use icon descriptors as a visually concise alternative to textual labels—to help users quickly identify the available communication channels.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
- Refrain from using icon descriptors when you have multiple values for similar channels, such as work and cellphone numbers.
</ExampleContainer>

### Embedded in a container component

You have the flexibility to embed Contact Details in a range of container components. 

This example demonstrates the component embedded within a [Card](/salt/components/card).

    border

### Quick Actions

You can define quick actions, which are one-click shortcuts to specific functions or features—such as launching a new email in Outlook, dialling a contact in Zoom.

Ensure that quick action buttons have Tooltip displayed as per the [Icon Only Button best practices](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/button/examples#icon-only)

### Collapsible

If you’re displaying supplementary details, you can configure them to be collapsible.

 <Diagram

    alt="Contact Details with collapsible details"
    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
- Consider making supplementary details collapsible when they contain secondary information, and don’t need to be on display at all times.
</ExampleContainer>

### List Version

The List Version allows you to display a snapshot of key details. It’s ideal when you have restricted real estate, such as in a client picker dropdown menu or a contact directory list.

In order to show as many options as possible, we recommend to keep data points no more than one line. Prioritise the most important values.
