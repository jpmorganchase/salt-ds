International Address Input is a pattern that gives users a set of form fields to input address information for specific countries.

## Pattern scope

The pattern is a form that displays relevant fields for a user-selected location. You can use this pattern to provide a consistent look and feel when implementing International Address Input interactions across your applications. Future versions of the pattern will cover use of APIs, use of autocompletion, and enhanced support for more locations.

The pattern aims to accommodate users worldwide, but your team may be able to take further steps that fall outside the scope of this pattern. For example, check with your tech partners if it is possible to detect user location and automatically adjust the form.

## When to use it

Use the pattern when your user needs to enter an address for a specific country. This could be for shipping, contact, legal or compliance purposes, such as for a client onboarding flow or client detail collection process.

## Pattern content

The pattern consists of Salt Form Field components (for layout guidance, please refer to the [Forms pattern](./forms)). It comprises two formats: Dynamic and Generic.

### Dynamic format

Dynamic format generates templates based on country or region. The templates only display fields that are relevant to a specific country, in a recognizable order, and with familiar labels.

For the initial release, Dynamic format supports five countries: France, Germany, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.

We recommend using templates in Dynamic format with localized language and terms that are more familiar to the user. This will reduce barriers to input and minimize user errors.

### Generic format

Generic format provides a single template of international address input for all countries and regions.

In some cases, it may be difficult to use templates due to requirements or product scope. In these cases, use Generic format.

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Choose the format that best fits the technical capabilities of your app,
  delivery timescales, and required locations. - Combine Dynamic format and
  Generic format if users will input international addresses across the world.
  You can provide templates using both Generic and Dynamic formats.Â

## Adding an additional address

There may be cases where an additional address form is needed:

- The client address may be different to the business address. We recommend a checkbox after the first form for the user to select if they need the additional form.
- In some countries, such as China, users are required to input the address twice: once in English and then in Chinese. Add an additional form in the local language.

## Customized Address Forms

There may be cases where you need to customize the address form considering other information you are collecting based on the product scope.

- An additional form e.g. House No. may be needed.
- The address form can be used alongside international phone number, email address, banking details, time zone selection, and other fields.

## Toggling the local language

You can add a switch to toggle localization after the country selection to enable users to compare the form with another address or data source.

## Expanding the pattern

If you find a need to expand the pattern, for example to have localized Dynamic templates for more countries or regions, please reach out to the team to discuss.
