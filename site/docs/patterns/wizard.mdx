## When to use

Use wizard to guide users through a series of steps or tasks in a specific, linear order, often with the goal of completing a complex process (e.g., software installation, account setting/onboarding, checkout). Users must complete each step in order before moving to the next.

## How to build

### Anatomy

Wizard contains:
1. **Workflow title**: use a standardized, actionable title that clearly reflects the intent of the wizard (e.g., “Create a new account”). The title should remain consistent across all steps to maintain context.
2. **Step title**: to reflect the current step which vary per step. Step titles should be concise, descriptive, and clearly reflect the purpose of each step. Use plain language that is easy for users to understand. 
3. **Stepper**: to reflect status and progress through steps. 
4. **Content area**: displays the relevant application content for the current step, guiding the user’s attention to a specific task or piece of information. Ensure the content is focused, uncluttered, and directly supports the user’s progress through the wizard.
5. **Button bar**: possible actions for users to take. The button bar should behave the same across contexts, ensuring users have predictable access to navigation and primary/secondary actions.

## Container

A wizard can be displayed inside different containers such as dialogs, pages, or panels. Regardless of container, the arrangement of internal components and interactions remains consistent.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  Only display one wizard at a time, and avoid linking from one wizard to another.
</GuidanceCallout>

## Layout
- The title areas of wizard is consistent with Salt [header block](/salt/patterns/header-block) pattern.
- Use a [stepper](/salt/components/stepper) component to display the steps of the flow. 
- Follow the [button bar pattern](/salt/patterns/button-bar) guidance for button order layout and button positions in multi-step flows.

## Horizontal stepper vs vertical stepper

We recommend using a horizontal stepper for shorter and simpler tasks. For more lengthy and complex task flows, use a vertical stepper to break down the process into steps and substeps.

### The number of steps

For simpler flows, a horizontal stepper with fewer steps is usually sufficient. If your process involves a large amount of content, consider using a vertical stepper and a wide, shallow structure. This means breaking the process into more steps with fewer fields per step, and using substeps to group closely related sections. This approach, supported by Miller’s Law (7 ± 2), helps reduce cognitive load and improves usability compared to having fewer steps with many fields.

## Content area scrolling

Fix the button bar at the bottom of the wizard—refer to the fixed approach in Button bar position—so users can always access actions. Allow the main content area to scroll as needed, but avoid duplicative scrollbars in different orientations (for example, both in the browser and within the wizard). This keeps the interface clean and ensures actions remain accessible at all times.

To be able to see more content from the screen (vertically), the main content area within the wizard should scroll, while the bottom button bar stays fixed for consistent access to actions.

###  With horizontal stepper

Workflows using a horizontal stepper typically involve fewer fields and simpler layouts. In most cases, scrolling should not be required. If additional content does exceed the available space, only the central content region should scroll—keeping the stepper and button bar visible at all times.

### With vertical stepper

Vertical steppers are used for longer or more complex workflows that may include multiple steps and substeps. In these cases, allow the main content area to scroll vertically to accommodate more content on the screen. The bottom button bar remains fixed so users can always access key actions without needing to scroll back down.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  For guidance on displaying form fields across multiple columns within a wizard, refer to [forms](/salt/patterns/forms#multiple-columns) pattern. It provides recommendations for multicolumn layouts, including when to use them—such as for experienced users, routine tasks, or when vertical space is limited and scrolling should be minimized.
</GuidanceCallout>

## Modal wizard

You can use a dialog component as a structure base for a modal wizard with a stepper when you need to insert the wizard within another task or flow. The header in the dialog should include the wizard title and stepper. 

For shorter tasks that temporarily become the user’s main focus, a modal experience is preferable, as it prevents interaction with the rest of the UI and helps focus the user’s attention on the specific task or information at hand.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  Do not include a close button, as it can be ambiguous whether the progress or the entered information will be saved or lost. Use a cancel button instead to clearly indicate the user’s intent to exit the flow, ensuring a conscious, deliberate action to stop the process.
</GuidanceCallout>

## Optional step

When a step is entirely optional and contains no required fields, you can indicate this beneath the step title (in stepper) and allow users to skip it by clicking the next button.

We also recommend to use the “All fields are optional” text in the description under the step title.

<Diagram

  border

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  Indicate the minority: When a step contains both required and optional fields, label only the few optional or required fields as needed.
</GuidanceCallout>

## Validation state

Wizard is capable of showing validation feedback. Feedback can occur either in real time (dynamically) as the user interacts with the form, click the next action, or after submission (when clicking the final action button, e.g., Submit), depending on the validation approach implemented.

When validation feedback is triggered:
- The stepper and buttons update to reflect the validation state.
- You can give the users options to resolve the issue before they can proceed forward. 
- Users can still go back or cancel the flow if needed.

### Warning

If a step contains a warning after validation:
- The step displays a warning icon.
- The next button remains enabled, as the next step can be accessed without the issue being resolved.
- The warning can appear dynamically (real-time validation) or after the action (on submission), depending on the system’s validation logic.
- Users can go back to review or adjust information as needed.

  border
  background="secondary"
/>

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  Before proceeding with the next action, if the current step contains warnings, we recommend offering users options to resolve them.
</GuidanceCallout>

### Error

When a step contains an error after validation:
- The step displays an error state
- The application highlights the issues in the specific fields or areas that need attention to be resolved.
- The next or submit button remains enabled for accessibility and discoverability, but clicking it again should refocus or re-highlight unresolved errors.
- The cancel and previous buttons remain enabled, allowing users to exit or navigate backward in the flow.
- If the validation passes, the flow proceeds to the next step or confirmation screen.

  alt="Wizard pattern with submission error"
  border
  background="secondary"
/>

## Confirmation messages

In certain use cases, you may want to provide additional feedback to users after an action is triggered. This includes showing warning, success, or other confirmation messages that help users stay informed and confident in their next steps.

Confirmation messages can appear:
- as a dialog, or
- as part of the wizard flow within a modal wizard.

### Warning message

When the user clicks the cancel button, display a warning message if there’s a risk of losing progress. This is especially useful in lengthy or critical flows where saving is not supported.

#### Wizard with the warning dialog

#### Modal wizard with the warning message

<Diagram
  src="/img/patterns/wizard/wizard-pattern-cancel-content-warning.png"
  alt="Wizard pattern in modal with cancel warning"
  border
  background="secondary"
/>

## Completion message

Use a completion message to confirm that the wizard task has been successfully completed. This helps users clearly understand that their action was successful and provides closure to the flow, especially when the task is critical.
