A form allows you to capture data, gather opinions and receive information in a consistent format.

This pattern provides practical and visually enriched guidelines for creating forms that are flexible to business domain, user experience and channel.

## When to use

Use a form to enable users to input and submit data. Forms can be simple and user-oriented, such as contact forms, surveys, and sign-up pages. They can also be complex and product-oriented, such as app preferences, settings, and multi-step forms split across different screens.

## How to build

### Anatomy

You can display a form as a dedicated page, within a dialog, nested into drawers or within a side panel. Independently of how a form is displayed, forms generally contain:

1. **Headings**
2. **Labels**
3. **Form controls**
4. **Helper text**
5. **Button bar**

For more details on button bar layout, visit the [button bar pattern](/salt/patterns/button-bar). 

## Layout

Form controls align to a column layout with an even number of columns across breakpoints.

A form control consists of a [form field](/salt/components/form-field) wrapped around:
- An input
- A combo box
- A dropdown
- A radio button or checkbox group

    { src: "/img/patterns/forms/form_layout_2.png", alt: "" },
  ]}
  label="Show spacing"
/>

You can find more information on the Salt spacing system [here](../foundations/spacing).

<ExampleContainer type="positive" label="Best practices">
- Align the width of a form field to the number of columns that best reflect the length of its expected text.
- Use the Figma “Salt Layout Grid” style library, which aligns to Salt breakpoints. Pick the style that fits to your density and frame width.
- Use “Compact layout” for very data-dense forms.
</ExampleContainer>

#### Headings

Headings create more visual separation (after choosing field and background fill color) and group related fields. This helps users complete forms.

- Each heading adds space above for more separation in the form.
- If your heading is followed by a description, spacing is reduced to reinforce the relationship between heading and description.

  ]}
  label="Show spacing"
/>

#### Sections and separators

Use horizontal separators to increase visual hierarchy alongside fills and headings. They use the tertiary separator style to denote sections of related fields or information.

/>
