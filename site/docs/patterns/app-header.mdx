The app header is a consistently available element that sits on top of every application interface. It contains a brand logo or mark and application-wide functionality, including navigation and utility actions. This pattern introduces guidelines to make the app header consistent and usable.

## When to use it

The app header serves as the primary element for users to orient themselves within the UI. It should be globally persistent, enabling easy navigation and access to utility functions.

## How to build it

### Anatomy

The app header has three functional areas:

1. **Branding:** Displays a brand logo or mark followed by the application name in text form. This should always link to the product’s home page.
2. **Navigation:** Serves as the container for the primary navigation. Its inclusion is optional if you have single-page applications or use a persistent side navigation.
3. **Utilities:** Provides access to persistent application-wide utilities, such as external links, search, notifications, help, account details and settings.

### Mobile layout construction

## Variants

### Header only

In this layout, the app header is globally persistent, and you can use it as standalone navigation for a small number of sections that don’t require secondary navigation. Although this layout provides more horizontal space for content, it has limited space for navigation items, and combined navigation may be required to navigate complex hierarchies.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/app-header/header-only.png"
    alt="Example of the header-only variant."
    border
  />

### Header with vertical navigation

The app header with vertical navigation offers an additional layer of hierarchy. This layout allows users to navigate complex structures and perform system and product tasks in the UI. Under this configuration, sub-menus can remain on display without interfering with the content. For more details about navigation hierarchy, visit the [navigation pattern](./navigation).  

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/app-header/with-vertical-nav.png"
    alt="Header paired with vertical navigation."
    border
  />

## Behaviors

### Responsive Behaviors

The app header is responsive to the width of the application viewport and responds dynamically to the [Salt breakpoints](/salt/foundations/responsiveness#breakpoints). As the app header scales down to fit smaller viewports, its elements adjust dynamically to provide the best possible user experience. 

For small viewport experiences, the app logo remains visible, while navigation and utility actions collapse into a hamburger menu positioned to left of the brand logo. The navigation items will sit on top of the utility actions in the hierarchy of the vertical navigation. 

#### Desktop

#### Mobile

    border
  />

<ExampleContainer type="positive">
 - Navigation items sit on top of the utility actions in the hierarchy of the hamburger menu.
 - If search utility action is part of the app header, keep search functionality persistently available for small viewports. 
 - Consider medium, large and extra large [Salt breakpoints](/salt/foundations/responsiveness#breakpoints) for desktop experiences. 
 - Consider extra small and small [Salt breakpoints](/salt/foundations/responsiveness#breakpoints) for mobile experiences.
</ExampleContainer>

### Sticky header position

The app header should sit in the north region, above the main, in a sticky position while the user scrolls down the page. This increases the discoverability of the elements in the header, where users can quickly access the navigation and utility actions elements without scrolling up to the top of the page. 

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/app-header/sticky-header.png"
    alt="The header stays in place while user scrolls."
    border
  />

## Accessibility

### Using skip links to bypass the app header

If you're implementing a complex app header with several navigation items and utility actions, you should precede the component with a skip link. This will enable keyboard and screen reader users to quickly shift focus to the main page content, and navigate your application more efficiently.

You can display and set focus to a skip link when the user moves focus from the previous component in the tab sequence to the app header—and configure the skip link to move focus to the main page content or an alternative target.

  <Diagram
    src="/img/patterns/app-header/skip-link.png"
    alt="The 'skip to content' link should be the first focusable element in the header."
    border
  />

*The "skip to content" link should be the first focusable element in the header.*

### Keyboard interactions

The underlying components provide many keyboard interactions (i.e., navigation items, dropdowns, buttons) and are available on their respective documentation pages.

The following keyboard interactions are specific to the app header:

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter">

- When the hamburger menu button is visible and has focus, Enter activates the button and displays the dropdown list of navigation items. 

- When focus is inside the hamburger menu list, Enter selects the navigation item with focus, closes the hamburger menu list and navigates the user to the target page. If the selected navigation item is a parent item, it will open the sub-items list under it.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="↑ / ↓">

- When the hamburger menu button is visible and has focus, this action activates the button and displays the dropdown list of navigation items. Sets focus to the currently selected item. 

- When focus is inside the hamburger menu list, moves focus to the previous or next navigation item in the list.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is above the app header, Tab moves focus to the navigation (or hamburger menu, if visible). 

- If focus is in the app header, Tab moves focus to the next focusable element within the app header in this order: hamburger menu, navigation and utility actions.

- If focus is on the last utility action, Tab moves focus out of the app header to the next focusable element in the tab sequence.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is below the app header, this action moves focus to the last item in the utility actions. 
- If focus is in the app header, this action moves moves focus to the previous focusable element within the app header. Focus moves back through elements in this order: utility actions, navigation and hamburger menu. 
- If focus is in the navigation (or hamburger menu, if visible), this action moves focus out of the app header to the previous focusable element in the tab sequence.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
