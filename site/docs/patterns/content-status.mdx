Content status is a pattern that provides information when content isn’t ready for display in a container component of an application.

It remains onscreen until a situation resolves or the user takes action, making it a great tool for communication and guidance.

## When to use

Use this pattern in a container component:
- When content is loading.
- To share information with users.
- To let users know there’s an error.
- When the user has successfully submitted content.

## How to build

Content status consists of visual status indicators ([`Progress`](/salt/components/progress), [`Spinner`](/salt/components/spinner), [`StatusIndicator`](/salt/components/status-indicator)) and text elements as supporting messages. You can add a [button](/salt/components/button) to reload content or perform a different action if it will help your users. Use [`StackLayout`](/salt/components/stack-layout) to arrange the structure of the components vertically.

- Make sure the solution fills the height and width of the container component.
- You should horizontally and vertically center titles and supporting messages in the container.
</ExampleContainer>

### Supporting messages

- **Have a clear hierarchy**: Your titles should be stand-alone, revealing key information your users need to know without relying on the supporting message, which users may skim over.
- **Be helpful**: If it’s possible for your users to resolve or rectify an issue, make sure you state this clearly.
- **Keep it simple**: Try to limit titles to a single line and supporting messages to no more than three lines.

## Loading content

We've used a [progress](/salt/components/progress) component in this example to help manage user expectations. If you know how long it will take to load or process content, use this to let your users know.

  alt="Example showing a content status with a progress indicator"
  border
/>

We've used a [spinner](/salt/components/spinner) component to reassure users in this example. Use this to let your users know that content is loading or processing without sharing an exact time frame.

## Sharing information

Use this variant to communicate useful information. For example, if there’s no data available, this variation can communicate that message to let users know why they can't see any content.

<Diagram

  alt="Example showing a content status with an info indicator"
  border
/>

Use the warning status to inform users of an issue or potential issue related to their current task. Use this for issues that don't prevent the user from continuing or completing their task. This could include a system status that may cause issues at a later point.

  alt="Example showing a content status with a warning indicator"
  border
/>

## Error messages

Use the error status to communicate a critical issue that prevents the user from continuing or completing the task. This could include missing content or user information required.

<Diagram
  src="/img/patterns/content-status/error.png"
  alt="Example showing a content status with an error indicator"
  border
/>

<ExampleContainer type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
 Error and warning messages should: 
 1. Notify users when there’s an issue. 
 2. Identify and explain the issue. 
 3. Provide a resolution.
</ExampleContainer>


## Success message

This example lets users know that content has been successfully processed, e.g., the user has completed and submitted a form.
