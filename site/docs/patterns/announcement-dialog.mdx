## When to use

Use an announcement dialog to focus the user's attention on new product features or the highlights of a recent release with a follow-up action, such as "Download update" or "Upgrade". They can also be used to display a notification that doesn't require a response from the user, such as a welcome message for new users or an upcoming site-maintenance notification.

## How to build

### Anatomy

An announcement dialog comprises four key features:

1. **Pre-header**: optional labels that can be used to display the product name, announcement type, or a common descriptor when there are multiple announcements.
2. **Heading**: serves as the main title of the announcement.
3. **Content area**: provides additional information or context to the announcement.
4. **Image**: an image of the new feature or visual elements that add appeal and clarity to important messages.
5. **Button bar**: possible actions for users to take.

### Layout

- Use the [Header block](/salt/patterns/header-block) to display a header and pre-header.
- Use the [Dialog](/salt/components/dialog) and it's components as the base structure of the announcement dialog.
- Use a [Button bar](/salt/patterns/button-bar) to display any actions at the bottom of the dialog. See the [Button bar](/salt/patterns/button-bar) pattern to understand how to implement actionable interactions within dialogs across your applications.

## Multi-announcement dialog

If there are multiple features that need to be announced, include a progress label showing the current and total number of slides in the [Button bar](/salt/patterns/button-bar). The slide indicator uses `--salt-spacing-200` from the core buttons.

## Disclaimers

If you need to provide legal information for compliance purposes, you can include disclaimer text beneath the [Button bar](/salt/patterns/button-bar).

**Note**: If your announcement dialog has multiple slides, the disclaimer text should appear on all of them.

## Full image

If your announcement would benefit from a large image, vertically stack the content area and image. Apply `--salt-spacing-300` between announcement description and image.

## Content area scrolling

In most cases, scrolling shouldn't be required. If additional content does exceed the available space, only the content area and image should scroll together - keeping the header and button bar visible at all times.

- The content in the announcement description should be short and concise. This allows users to quickly grasp the necessary information, reducing cognitive load and preventing abandonment.
- By default, the entire image or infographics should be visible without scrolling. To achieve this, adjust the size of the dialog or check that the image is appropriately cropped.

## Responsive behavior

Once the announcement dialog hits a certain breakpoint, you can configure the layout to either:

1. Stack the announcement description and image.
2. Change the orientation to stack the button bar, following the [Button bar](/salt/patterns/button-bar).

### Stacked content area

This mirrors the full image dialog mentioned above.
