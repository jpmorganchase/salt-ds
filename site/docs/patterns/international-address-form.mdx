title: International address form
description: "An international address form gives users a set of form fields to input address information for specific countries. The form displays relevant fields for a user-selected location.\n\nThe pattern aims to accommodate users worldwide, but your team may be able to take further steps that fall outside its scope. For example, check with your tech partners if it's possible to detect user location and automatically adjust the form.\n\nFuture versions of this pattern will cover the use of APIs, autocompletion and enhanced support for more locations."

## When to use

Use it when your user needs to enter an address for a specific country. This could be for shipping, contact, legal or compliance purposes, such as client onboarding flow or client detail collection processes.

## How to build

### Anatomy

1. **Address form elements**: Allows the user to input their details such as their name, address, postal code, town/city and optionally their state/province.
2. **Country selector**: Allows the user to select the correct country for their address.

### Layout

* Use `Input` to display the address form elements.
* Use `Dropdown` to display the country selector.
* Use `StackLayout` to display the pattern elements in a column. 

For further layout guidance, please refer to the [form pattern](../forms).

## Dynamic format

The dynamic format uses form field labels specific to a country or region. The form only displays fields relevant to a specific country in a recognizable order and with familiar labels. This will reduce barriers to input and minimize user errors.

### Generic format

The generic format uses a single international address form for all countries and regions.

Sometimes, using templates may be difficult due to requirements or product scope. In these cases, use the generic format.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  - Choose the format that best fits the technical capabilities of your app, delivery timescales and required locations. 
  - Combine dynamic formats and generic formats if users input international addresses worldwide. You can provide templates using both generic and dynamic formats.
</GuidanceCallout>

## Additional addresses

There may be cases where users will need an additional address form. For example, where the client's address may be different from the business address. We recommend a checkbox after the first form for users to select if they need the additional form.

## Customized address forms

Sometimes, you need to customize the address form while considering other information you're collecting based on the product scope.

- You may need an additional form field, e.g., House No..
- You can use the address form alongside other fields. This may include international phone number, email address, banking details, time zone selection and others.
