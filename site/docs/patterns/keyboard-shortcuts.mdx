## When to use

Use this pattern to:
- Increase task efficiency by enabling users to perform actions quickly.
- Provide a true alternative to mouse or trackpad navigation, supporting users who prefer or require keyboard input.
- Clearly communicate available shortcuts to help users discover and learn efficient workflows.
- Allow users to search for and execute actions directly from the keyboard, improving accessibility and user experience.

## How to build

### Anatomy

1. **Keyboard shortcuts switch**: A switch that allows users to turn the keyboard shortcuts list on or off.
2. **Filter**: This allows users to quickly search and locate specific shortcuts by typing keywords.
3. **Action name**: ctions represent user-initiated commands—such as Save or Delete—that correspond to defined shortcuts. Each action should be clearly named to reflect the UI command executed by the shortcut.
4. **Description**: For actions that are unique to your application or require additional context, a brief description can be provided to help users understand their purpose.
3. **Key**: Each keyboard shortcut consists of two types of keys—modifier keys and character keys—which work together to trigger the action.

- Use Combo box to display search field.
- Use Table to display keyboard shortcut list.
