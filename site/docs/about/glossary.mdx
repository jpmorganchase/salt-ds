# Glossary

## Characteristic

A Salt characteristic refers to a [design token](#design-token) that aligns with a holistic semantic used throughout the design language.

For a full list of characteristics, refer to the [characteristic documentation](/salt/themes/characteristic-tokens).

## Component

Salt components serve as foundational building blocks as well as representing design primitives. Users of Salt can design and implement their own [patterns](#pattern) within their own scope.

For a full list of foundational components, refer to the [component documentation](/salt/components/index).

## Design Token

A design token is a visual attribute that represents a specific aspect of a design system. It is an abstract representation of a design property, such as colors, typography, spacing, or breakpoints, that can be used consistently across a product or design system. Design tokens provide a centralized and reusable way to define and manage design-related values, making it easier to maintain consistency and make global design changes. They act as a bridge between designers and developers, enabling a shared language and ensuring design consistency throughout the product or system. In Salt design tokens are represented as Figma variables and in code, they take the form of CSS variables.

## Pattern

Salt [components](#component) are designed and developed with composability in mind. The component foundations serve as building blocks that can be combined to support specific use-cases, whether it's through design or development. Instead of publishing every use-case as a separate component or variant, we aim to keep the component foundation focused and avoid unnecessary complexity. Patterns are published as designs which can be re-implemented within your own code by composing together the foundational components.

For a full list of foundational patterns, refer to the [pattern documentation](/salt/patterns/index).

## Salt

Salt is the J.P. Morgan design system, an open-source solution for building exceptional products and digital experiences in financial services and other industries. It offers you well-documented, accessible components as well as comprehensive design templates, style libraries and assets.

## Theming

Salt is under active development. At this stage, we don't recommend theming unless absolutely necessary.

For an overview of theming, refer to our [theming documentation](/salt/themes/index).
