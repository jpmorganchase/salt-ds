## Characteristic

A Salt characteristic refers to a [design token](#design-token) that aligns with a holistic semantic used throughout the design language.

For a full list of characteristics, refer to the [characteristic documentation](/salt/themes/characteristic-tokens).

## Component

Salt components serve as foundational building blocks as well as representing design primitives. Users of Salt can design and implement their own [patterns](#pattern) within their own scope.

For a full list of foundational components, refer to the [component documentation](/salt/components/index).

## Design token

A design token is a visual attribute that represents a specific aspect of a design system. It is an abstract representation of a design property, such as colors, typography, spacing, or breakpoints, that can be used consistently across a product or design system. Design tokens provide a centralized and reusable way to define and manage design-related values, making it easier to maintain consistency and make global design changes. They act as a bridge between designers and developers, enabling a shared language and ensuring design consistency throughout the product or system. In Salt design tokens are represented as Figma variables and in code, they take the form of CSS variables.

## Pattern

Salt [components](#component) are designed and developed with composability in mind. The component foundations serve as building blocks that can be combined to support specific use-cases, whether it's through design or development. Instead of publishing every use-case as a separate component or variant, we aim to keep the component foundation focused and avoid unnecessary complexity. Patterns are published as designs which can be re-implemented within your own code by composing together the foundational components.

For a full list of foundational patterns, refer to the [pattern documentation](/salt/patterns/index).

## Salt

Salt is the J.P. Morgan design system, an open-source solution for building exceptional products and digital experiences in financial services and other industries. It offers you well-documented, accessible components as well as comprehensive design templates, style libraries and assets.

## Theming

Salt is under active development. At this stage, we don't recommend theming unless absolutely necessary.

For an overview of theming, refer to our [theming documentation](/salt/themes/index).

## Disabled state

A component in a disabled state isn't considered relevant to the user’s workflow at that time. As the function isn't available to the user, the component doesn't need to meet minimum contrast requirements. Consider if a disabled state is the right UI pattern, or if a progressive reveal might be more appropriate. Salt doesn't offer error, warning, or success states for disabled components, as these imply required user action; consider using a read-only state or progressive reveal instead. Some components have exceptions, such as Button, so it can be discovered where context is important.

## Read-only state

A component in a read-only state is considered relevant to the user’s workflow, allowing users to view and interact with the content without modifying it. It must meet accessibility requirements, including minimum contrast. The system supports status messages for read-only components, as RAG states may require visibility for recognition and further action. Consider if a read-only state is the right UI pattern, or if a disabled state might be more appropriate when modification is not needed.
