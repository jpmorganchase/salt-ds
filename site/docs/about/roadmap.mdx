## How we prioritize our work

We track all our work using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/salt-ds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) so if you see an issue that you're interested in please leave an üëç.

We use the below list to determine how we should prioritize our work.

1. Currently in progress
2. High occurrence across our matrix of patterns from strategically important partner teams
3. Overall feedback as high business priority, plus Figma component usage analytics
4. Overall feedback as high business priority (not including Figma component usage analytics)
5. Medium occurrence across our matrix of patterns
6. Overall feedback as medium business priority, plus Figma analytics
7. Overall feedback as medium business priority (not including Figma)
8. Low occurrence across our matrix of patterns
9. Overall feedback as low business priority, plus Figma analytics
10. Overall feedback as low business priority (not including Figma)
11. Figma analytics only
