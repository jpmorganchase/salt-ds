# Designing with Salt

<Content toc={toc}>

Salt provides a comprehensive set of components and styles, which include themes, typography, color palettes, iconography and more. Use the components as they are, out of the box, or adapt them to suit the needs of your business or application.

## Accessibility first

One of our main objectives is to offer a complete solution for building great, accessible experiences.

To ensure the Salt Design System is fully accessible and inclusive, we thoroughly test all our components against WCAG 2.1 AA criteria. This includes checking that they:

- Meet color contrast ratios across small and large text, for best legibility.
- Reduce users’ cognitive load—with imagery, text size and behavior collectively indicating a clear hierarchy of information.
- Are optimized for keyboard input and screen readers, using ARIA roles, states and properties that comply with accessibility standards.

## What you’ll need

To start designing with Salt, you should:

- Have an active Figma account.
- Install the Salt font libraries, Open Sans and PT Mono. If you don’t already have them, you can [download them from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800|PT+Mono).

## The step-by-step process

### 1. Enable the Figma libraries

We maintain a comprehensive set of up-to-date libraries in Figma, to help you make beautiful, consistently-designed UIs and applications.

To start using a library:

- Select the “Assets” tab on the left-hand panel to access the libraries.
- Click on the book icon and search for “Salt” in Libraries.
- Pick the library you need from the set of available libraries (shown in the table below).

<table style={{ tableLayout: "fixed" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Salt asset libraries</th>
      <th>What they contain</th>
      <th>Design specifications</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Components: Dark</td>
      <td>Dark-themed components in high, medium, low and touch densities</td>
      <td>
        <FigmaLink />
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Components: Light</td>
      <td>Light-themed components in high, medium, low and touch densities</td>
      <td>
        <FigmaLink />
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Icons</td>
      <td>Salt’s icon set</td>
      <td>
        <FigmaLink />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<table style={{ tableLayout: "fixed" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Salt style libraries</th>
      <th>What they contain</th>
      <th>Design specifications</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Layout Grid</td>
      <td>Layout grid styles for all densities</td>
      <td>
        <FigmaLink />
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mode: Dark</td>
      <td>Semantic palette for dark mode UIs, components and shadows</td>
      <td>
        <FigmaLink />
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mode: Light</td>
      <td>Semantic palette for light mode UIs, components and shadows</td>
      <td>
        <FigmaLink />
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Theme Palette</td>
      <td>The Salt theme’s full foundational color palette</td>
      <td>
        <FigmaLink />
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Typography</td>
      <td>Typography ramp that’s suitable for all densities</td>
      <td>
        <FigmaLink />
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 2. Add components to your designs

<DesignCards />

#### Swapping from light to dark theme and vice versa

If you’ve created your design in one mode and need to change it, use Figma’s Swap Library function to update it instantly—without having to start again.

Learn more about [how to swap libraries in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404856784663-Swap-style-and-component-libraries#:~:text=Swap%20library%20lets%20you%20replace,style%20or%20component%20name%20only).

### 3. Apply semantic colors

Semantic colors are the light and dark theme libraries that define colors for specific uses, for example, for containers, separators, actionable components, etc. Colors are preassigned to components, but you can also apply them in your designs.

To access the full range of semantic colors in Figma, you need to enable the theme palette library as follows:

- Open the “Assets” panel on the left-hand menu.
- Select the book icon to open the libraries, and then search for “Theme Palette.”
- Enable the library to access the full range of Salt colors.
- Apply the colors using the Fill area (as fill or stroke) that’s within the design panel on the right-hand side of the Figma UI.

### 4. Select icons, if needed

Icons are available in SVG format, in three sizes (large, medium and small) and in all four densities.

Although icons are embedded within all of our components, you can change an icon to one that’s more suitable to your specific use case. To do this directly from the icon library, swap the instance using the variants panel on the right-hand side.

<SoloImgCard />

#### Understanding our icon sizes

We provide two types of icon: default and solid.

Our base size for HD/default is 10px. However, for accessibility and visual design reasons, we don’t recommend icon sizes that are smaller than 12px. Therefore, our default HD icons start at 12px but they increase size in multiples of 10px—so that 2X size is 20px, 4X is 40px, etc.

The default icon set is 12px for both high and medium density, 14px for low density and 16px for touch density. If necessary, you can adjust your icon size according to your UI designs in multiples of 2X, 3X, 4X, etc.
