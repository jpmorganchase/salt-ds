Salt provides a comprehensive set of components and styles, which include themes, typography, color palettes, iconography and more. Designers can use the components as they are, out of the box, or adapt them to suit the needs of a business or application.

## Checking off prerequisites

To start designing with Salt, you should allow 30 minutes and begin with the following:

- Make sure you have an active Figma account.
- To use the Salt [typography](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/foundations/typography) style, install the Open Sans, PT Mono and Amplitude fonts. If you don't already have them, you can [download Open Sans and PT Mono from Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800|PT+Mono)
  - If you are a JPMC employee and Mac user, download the Amplitude font from Self Service by searching for JPMC Brand Fonts. You can find additional guidance on [Salt's Resources page about fonts.](https://go/salt-ds/resources/index)

## Setting up Figma libraries

Watch our [tutorial video](https://go/salt-ds/content/insights/tutorials/20250109-saltds-figma-getting-started) (JPMC Employees Only) on setting up Salt DS Figma libraries for your project.
We maintain a comprehensive set of up-to-date libraries in Figma to help you make beautiful, consistently designed UIs and applications. If you want to start using Salt Design System for your project, first you need to set up the Salt libraries on Figma with the steps below.

## Salt DS libraries

Salt offers the following libraries in Figma. You'll be installing those that best suit your needs.

| Library                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Salt DS Components and Patterns <Tag>Essential</Tag> | This library includes all Salt DS components and patterns that are represented in code and are documented on the site. To use Salt components and patterns directly, please install this library.                                               |
| Salt DS Themes <Tag>Essential</Tag>                   | This library includes all typography and effect styles as well as all color, size, and spacing variables needed for the themes available within the components and patterns library. All variables are reflective of the design tokens in code. |
| Salt DS Assets                  | This library offers Salt icons and country symbols.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Salt DS Logos                   | This library contains logo variations, including J.P. Morgan, Chase, and dual brand logos. This library is for internal JPMC use only.                                                                                                          |

<Callout status="warning" title="Salt DS JPM Brand Colors, Legacy (UITK) Colors libraries">
The color libraries below provide the color variables for each theme. Using these color variables directly in a design file is not recommended as it does not reflect the way Salt components reference colors in code. 
Instead, please use the semantic variables provided in the Salt DS Themes Figma library.
</Callout>

| Library                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Following these steps
### Step 1: Open new design file
Start by opening a new design file in Figma. You’ll notice some pre-installed libraries in the 'Assets' panel. Click on the library icon located in the 'Assets' panel to manage your libraries.
<Diagram

  srcDark="/img/design-getting-started/get-started-step1-dark.png"
  alt="Screenshot of navigating to Figma assets panel"
  border
  background="secondary"
/>

### Step 2: Declutter your workspace
Identify any libraries you don’t need and click the 'Remove' button on the right side to tidy your workspace.
<Diagram

  srcDark="/img/design-getting-started/get-started-step2-dark.png"
  alt="Screenshot of decluttering workspace"
  border
  background="secondary"
/>

### Step 3: Browse libraries
Once your workspace is clean, click the 'Browse team libraries' button to search for and install new libraries.
<Diagram
  src="/img/design-getting-started/get-started-step3.png"
  srcDark="/img/design-getting-started/get-started-step3-dark.png"
  alt="Screenshot of clicking Browse team libraries button"
  border
  background="secondary"
/>

### Step 4: Search for Salt DS libraries
In the search field, type “Salt DS” to see the Salt DS libraries. Alternatively, type the whole name of the library you want to install. You can find the essential Salt DS libraries info in the table above.
<Diagram
  src="/img/design-getting-started/get-started-step4.png"
  srcDark="/img/design-getting-started/get-started-step4-dark.png"
  alt="Screenshot of searching Sald DS libraries"
  border
  background="secondary"
/>

### Step 5: Add library to your file
Click the 'Add to file' button to include a Salt DS library in your design file. For details on each library, see the section below.
<Diagram

  srcDark="/img/design-getting-started/get-started-step5-dark.png"
  alt="Screenshot of clicking Add to file button"
  border
  background="secondary"
/>

### Step 6: Confirm library setup completion
Now, you'll be able to see the available Salt DS libraries in the 'Assets' panel. You can start using it in your design projects. Next, when you successfully add a component to your project, you'll know for certain that the library is in place.

## Salt design asset definitions

This table shows the definitions of different Salt design assets in Figma:

| Figma mechanisms           | Salt Code equivalent: Component or Pattern                                          | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Figma Component            | [Salt Component](/salt/components/index/)                                           | Should not be detached because it's configured by props and should be kept as close as possible to the coded component. May contain ‘swap’ elements for additional composability.                                  |
| Figma 'Template' Component | [Salt Component](/salt/components/index/) and [Salt Pattern](/salt/patterns/index/) | Designed to be detached for further reuse and comprised of nested components. Basic configuration props enable you to define and configure the best starting point before detaching.                               |
| Figma Sticker              | [Salt Component](/salt/components/index/) and [Salt Pattern](/salt/patterns/index/) | Figma examples built by Salt or App teams with Salt DS. Provided as frames, not components, that can be copied and pasted from our Sticker sheet file into your projects as a starter.                             |
