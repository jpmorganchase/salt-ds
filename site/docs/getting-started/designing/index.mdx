## What you’ll need

To start designing with Salt, you should:

- Have an active Figma account.
- To use the Salt typography style, install the Open Sans, PT Mono, and Amplitude fonts. If you don't already have them, you can [download Open Sans and PT Mono from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800|PT+Mono). If you are a JPMC employee, you can download the Amplitude font from Self Service.

## Set up the Figma libraries

Watch our [tutorial video](https://go/salt-ds/news/videos/20250109-saltds-figma-getting-started) on setting up Salt DS Figma libraries for your project. (JPMC Employees Only)

We maintain a comprehensive set of up-to-date libraries in Figma, to help you make beautiful, consistently designed UIs and applications. If you want to start using Salt Design System for your project, first you need to set up the Salt libraries on your Figma.

May contain ‘swap’ elements for additional composability.                           |
| Figma 'Template' Component | [Salt Component](/salt/components/index/) and [Salt Pattern](/salt/patterns/index/) | A Figma component that comprises of nested components and is **designed to be detached** for further reuse.
