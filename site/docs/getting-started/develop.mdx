# Develop with Salt

<div className='docs-page-content'>

Learn how to use Salt's UI components in your React web applications.

## What you’ll need

To start developing with Salt, you should:

- Be familiar with React and web development fundamentals (such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript).
- Have Node.js (version 16 or later) installed on your system.
- Create a React (version 16 or later) web application project. For new projects, use create-react-app or a similar tool.

## The step-by-step process

### 1. Install the Salt packages

There are three dependencies that you need to add to your project:

- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-core` contains production-ready UI components.
- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme` contains CSS files that apply Salt's default theme.
- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-icons` contains SVG-based icons.

Use this npm command to install all three dependencies in one go:

`npm install --save @jpmorganchase/uitk-core @jpmorganchase/uitk-theme @jpmorganchase/uitk-icons`

If you prefer not to use npm, you can install the packages using yarn or other package managers.

### 2. Add required web fonts

Salt’s default theme requires the Open Sans and PT Mono web fonts. Use one of the following methods to integrate them into your application.

**Use Google Fonts**

To load the fonts directly from Google Fonts, add the following into your application’s index.html file:

```
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link
href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2 family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,500;0,600;0,700;0,800;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,600;1,700;1,800&family=PT+Mono&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

For further details and alternative methods, refer to the instructions on Google Fonts tear-out.

**Use FontSource**

You install FontSource’s npm packages and then import their CSS into your application. This will include the necessary web font files into your build so that you can self-host them.

First, install the required NPM packages:

`npm install –save @fontsource/open-sans @fontsource/pt-mono`

Next, import the CSS for the weights and styles that Salt requires. In a typical React project setup, the best place to put these imports is in your src/index.js file:

```
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/300.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/300-italic.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/400.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/400-italic.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/500.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/500-italic.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/600.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/600-italic.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/700.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/700-italic.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/800.css";
    import "@fontsource/open-sans/800-italic.css";
    import "@fontsource/pt-mono";
```

**Other**

If you prefer not to use Google Fonts or FontSource, you can use any other approach to incorporate the required web font files. Make sure the CSS @font-face declarations associate the following combinations of font-family, font-weight and font-style with the corresponding web font files:

### 3. Integrate Salt into your app

To integrate Salt into your project, import the CSS theme and ToolkitProvider component—and then wrap your application in it.

For example, in a typical React project, you can do this in your src/index.js as follows:

```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

// Import <ToolkitProvider>
import { ToolkitProvider } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

// Import theme CSS
import "@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme/index.css";

// Wrap your application in a <ToolkitProvider>
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")); root.render(

<ToolkitProvider>
  <App />
</ToolkitProvider>
);
```

### 4. Import components

Congratulations, you're now ready to use our UI components. You can now import them from the `@jpmorganchase/uitk-core` package and use them in your JSX code.

For example:

```
import { Button } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

function App() {
return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}

export default App;
```

Head over to our available components to view their respective APIs.

### 5. Play with labs components

Our `@jpmorganchase/uitk-labs` package is where we introduce new components that are in the initial stages of development. Once they’re stable, we move them over to the core package.

Because it’s an unstable environment that may cause major breaking changes, we don’t recommend using labs components in production applications. However, early adopters are welcome to use and experiment with them.
