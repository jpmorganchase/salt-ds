## Q2 2023 delivery

Our prioritization is based on alignment with strategically important product teams, feedback from the broader business, and component dependencies.

We're also more deliberately working to deliver components to support implementation of specific patterns and flows.

_Patterns currently supported by the existing Salt components are; Footer, Button bar, Breadcrumbs, Metric, Content status._
