## How we prioritize our work

We use the below list to determine how we should prioritize our work.

1. Currently in progress
2. High occurrence across our matrix of patterns from strategically important partner teams
3. Overall feedback as high business priority, plus Figma component usage analytics
4. Overall feedback as high business priority (not including Figma component usage analytics)
5. Medium occurrence across our matrix of patterns
6. Overall feedback as medium business priority, plus Figma analytics
7. Overall feedback as medium business priority (not including Figma)
8. Low occurrence across our matrix of patterns
9. Overall feedback as low business priority, plus Figma analytics
10. Overall feedback as low business priority (not including Figma)
11. Figma analytics only

## Q2 2023

Our prioritization is based on alignment with strategically important product teams, feedback from the broader business, and component dependencies.

We're also more deliberately working to deliver components to support implementation of specific patterns and flows.
