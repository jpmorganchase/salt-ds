<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="Default" >

Border Layout can be set to display five regions: North, East, South, West and Center. At least one region but must be displayed alongside the Center region in the layout.

By default, there are no gaps between regions.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="CustomRegionSize" >

You can manually define the size of regions. This example shows how to set the West and East regions to a fixed width, with a responsive Center region.

This layout would work well where a fixed-width side navigation is required, alongside responsive page content.

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="GapBetweenRegions" >

A gap can be added between each region. The`gap` property is a multiplier that aligns to the [Salt spacing system](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/foundations/spacing).

- The standard gap between column and row elements in Salt is 3 times the base unit.

- Use `columnGap` and `rowGap` properties to set a specific gap in a particular dimension or `gap` to update both values simultaneously.

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="HideRegions" >

Border Layout can display any combination of Border Items. This example demonstrates a layout with North, East and Center regions.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="BorderItemPosition" >

Set the `position` property of the Border Item wrapper to define where content should be displayed in the layout: North, East, South, West, Center.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="BorderItemAlignment" >

User the `verticalAlignment` and `horizontalAlignment` properties of the Border Item wrapper to determine how content should be aligned in the region.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="StickyPositioning" >

Use the `sticky` property of the Border Item wrapper to define a region as sticky. When set to `true`, content in surrounding regions will scroll beneath a `sticky` Border Item.

This is particularly useful if you require a header, (in the North region) or side navigation (in the West) to remain visible at all times.
