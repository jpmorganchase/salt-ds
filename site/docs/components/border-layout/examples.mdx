## Default

You can set `BorderLayout` to display five regions: North, East, South, West and Center. You must display at least one region alongside the Center region in the layout.

By default, there are no gaps between regions.

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="Default" />

## Custom region size

You can manually define the size of regions. This example shows how to set the West and East regions to a fixed width, with a responsive Center region.

This layout would work well where a fixed-width side navigation is necessary, alongside responsive page content.

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="CustomRegionSize" />

## Gap between regions

You can add a gap between each region. The `gap` prop is a multiplier that aligns to the [Salt spacing system](/salt/foundations/spacing).

- The standard gap between column and row elements in Salt is 3 times the base unit.
- Use `columnGap` and `rowGap` properties to set a specific gap in a particular dimension or `gap` to update both values simultaneously.

## Hide regions

`BorderLayout` can display any combination of border items. This example demonstrates a layout with North, West and Center regions.

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="HideRegions" />

## Border item position

Set the `position` property of the border item wrapper to define where content should be displayed in the layout: North, East, South, West or Center.

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="BorderItemPosition" />

## Border item alignment

Use the `verticalAlignment` and `horizontalAlignment` properties of the border item wrapper to determine how content should align in the region.

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="BorderItemAlignment" />

## Sticky positioning

Use the `sticky` prop of the border item wrapper to define a region as sticky. When you set it to `true`, content in surrounding regions will scroll beneath a `sticky` Border Item.

This is particularly useful if you require a region to remain visible at all times. For more information, see [CSS `position: sticky`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#sticky).

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="StickyPositioning" />

## Inner and Outer Spacing

The spacing properties `padding` and `margin` are set to 0 by default and can be used to control the layout's inner and outer spacing as multiples of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing).

<LivePreview componentName="border-layout" exampleName="Spacing" />
