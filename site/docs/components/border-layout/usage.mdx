### When to use Border Layout

- You need to manage the top-level layout of your application, or page, with at least one additional region alongside the main content area (e.g., for navigation or a footer).

### When not to use Border Layout

- Youâ€™re not managing the top-level layout of your application, but the layout inside one of the five Border Layout regions.

- If you want a customized layout that you can control in both row and column dimensions (for example, a Dashboard) we recommend using Grid Layout.

- If you want a side panel which temporarily reveals relevant content, consider using a Drawer component instead of a border layout region.
