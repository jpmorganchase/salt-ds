## Using the component

### When to use

- To manage the top-level layout of your application, or page, with at least one additional region alongside the main content area (e.g., for navigation or a footer).

### When not to use

- When you're not managing the top-level layout of your application, but the layout inside one of the five border layout regions.
- For a customized layout that you can control in both row and column dimensions (for example, a dashboard). Instead, use [`GridLayout`](../grid-layout).
- For a side panel that temporarily reveals relevant content. Instead, use [`Drawer`](../drawer).
