### Best practises

When building a page layout is it important to make sure we use semantic HTML, which means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

The Border Layout and Border Item components support this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.
