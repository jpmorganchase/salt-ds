title: Border Layout
data:
  description: Border Layout manages the top-level layout of your application, website, or widget. It defines five distinct regions. Four of these regions surround a main content region and are used for elements such as a footer, header or side navigation. Border Layout is built on top of Grid Layout and is specifically intended for entire website pages or application screens, where there is at least one additional region alongside the main area.
