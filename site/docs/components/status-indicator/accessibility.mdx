### Best practices

Decorative status indicators (status indicators that repeat the information already expressed by the accompanied text) should be hidden from the screen reader to avoid repetition. If you are adding a status indicator for decorative purposes, pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to hide its label from the screen reader.
