## Best practices

You should exclude decorative status indicators (status indicators that repeat the information already expressed by the accompanied text) from the screen reader to avoid repetition. If you're adding a status indicator for decorative purposes, pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to exclude its label from the screen reader.
