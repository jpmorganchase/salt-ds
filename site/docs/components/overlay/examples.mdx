## Default overlay

The basic overlay component allows the user to expose and interact with supplemental information. The overlay remains persistent until the user dismisses it.

<LivePreview componentName="overlay" exampleName="Default" />

## Placement

Use the `placement` prop to position overlay content to the `top`, `bottom`, `left` or `right` of the trigger element.

<LivePreview componentName="overlay" exampleName="Placement" />

## Close button

`OverlayPanelCloseButton` can be added as a child of the `OverlayPanel` component to render a close button in the top right corner of the OverlayPanel. You can pass the `onClick` prop like with any `Button` component to handle the close button click.

<LivePreview componentName="overlay" exampleName="CloseButton" />

## Long content

When overlay content extends beyond the set height, the content defaults to scroll. The close button remains sticky and accessible at all times.

<LivePreview componentName="overlay" exampleName="LongContent" />

## With actions

With actions, users can decide if interacting with content in the overlay should close the overlay. This example shows how activating the **Export** button triggers the export function, closes the overlay, and returns focus to the trigger element.

<LivePreview componentName="overlay" exampleName="WithActions" />

## ðŸš§ With header

`OverlayHeader`'s update follows our standardized header for container components and app regions, and it can be added as a child of the `OverlayPanel` component to provide a structured header for overlay. The header includes a title and actions that follows our Header Block pattern. This approach is recommended over using the `OverlayPanelCloseButton` separately.

**Note:** This change is currently in Lab.

<LivePreview componentName="overlay" exampleName="WithHeader" />
