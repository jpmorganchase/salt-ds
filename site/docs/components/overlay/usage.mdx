### Using the component

Interaction with the content in an overlay is typically constrained, as richer interactions/workflows should occur within a separate UI mechanism (such as a new page, [`Dialog`](/salt/components/dialog) or [`Drawer`](/salt/components/drawer)).

#### Best practices

1. To allow screen readers to correctly identify overlay's trigger and it's coresponding panel, define an `id` and pass the prop `id="YOUR-OVERLAY-ID"` to `Overlay` component.
2. To allow screen readers to correctly identify `OverlayPanel`'s content title and description respectively, add the prop `id="YOUR-OVERLAY-ID-header"` to your content header or title, and prop `id="YOUR-OVERLAY-ID-content"` to your content description.

#### When to use

- To expose interactive and essential elements within a tooltip to carry out in-context tasks.
- For filter or dropdown panels that overlay content.
- When acknowledgement on overlay content is needed. An overlay only dismissess after user interaction.

#### When not to use

- To notify and present critical information that requires immediate action from the user. Instead, use [`Dialog`](/salt/components/dialog).
- To provide a non-focusable and informative hint. Instead, use [`Tooltip`](/salt/components/tooltip).
