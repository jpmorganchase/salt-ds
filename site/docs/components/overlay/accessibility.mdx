### Interactions

- Users expose an overlay using a focusable UI element, such as a button. On button activation by either the <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> keys, focus enters the overlay.
- Users can close an overlay by a close button click or press, or clicking outside of the floating element. Users can also close an overlay by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> when focus is on the close button.
- The overlay's close button always receives focus before overlay content.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is on close button, Tab moves focus through focusable content elements in the overlay.
- If focus is on the last element in the overlay content, Tab wraps focus to the close button. Focus does not leave the overlay.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is on close button, this action moves focus to last focusable content element in the overlay.
- If focus is on the first element in the overlay content, this action wraps focus to the close button. Focus does not leave the overlay.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- If focus is on close button, this action closes the overlay. Focus returns to trigger element.
