### Using the Badge component

- If a numeric annotation exceeds the max value passed as a prop, a plus (+) sign will be displayed after the max value stated. In the case that no max value is passed to the component, the value will truncate after 3 digits and therefore display 999+ for any values over 999.

- If an alpha or text annotation in Badge exceeds four characters an ellipsis is used to truncate the annotation after the fourth character.

### When not to use Badge

- Badge must not indicate status through colour, such as red-amber-green or progress.

### Import

To import badge from the lab Salt package, use:

```
