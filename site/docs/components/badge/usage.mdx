### Using the component

If a numeric annotation exceeds the max value passed as a prop, there will be a plus (`+`) after the max value stated. If you don't pass a max value to the component, it will truncate the value after three digits displaying 999+ for any values over 999.

We recommend that you avoid using a badge with more than four to six characters. If needed, truncate strings exceeding this count with an ellipsis (â€¦).

#### When to use

- To communicate a non-interactive, system-driven change to the underlying component it anchors to, such as in tabs, pages and containers.

- Typically, if you use a badge to indicate an unread notification, you'd hide the badge once the user addresses the notification. However, badges can remain persistent depending on the context.

#### When not to use

- To organize content within categories, trigger an immediate action, or enable an action that may change depending on context. Instead, use [`Pill`](../pill).

- To communicate status through color, such as red/amber/green statuses. Instead, use `Pill`. Badges are independent of user action, so avoid using them to communicate something the user can directly influence through a task.
