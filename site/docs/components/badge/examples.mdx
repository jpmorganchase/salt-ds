  ### Default (top-right)

By default, `Badge` is in the top-right corner when attached to a child component such as an icon. Badges visually anchor to the attached component. As the number of alphanumeric characters increases, the badge width expands, but stays in the same place.

#### Best practices

Use a badge in the top-right corner to summarize the overall state of the content the badge is anchored to. For example, you may want to provide a quick overview of the number of new or unread items, using numeric values.

### Inline badge

To place a badge inline instead of in the top-right corner of an element, don't pass `children` to the badge.

#### Best practices

Using a badge inline with text clarifies which part of the content the badge relates to and allows specific details to be highlighted within the content to draw the userâ€™s attention. For example, you may use a badge within `TabNext`, inline with the text.

### Badge with maximum digits

Specify the maximum displayed number with the `max` prop. If `value` exceeds `max`, it will clamp the value and append a (`+`) suffix.

When you don't pass a max value to the component, the value will have a limitation of three digits by default, displaying 999+ for any values over 999.

  ### Badge with string

The `value` property can accept both a `number` and a `string`.
