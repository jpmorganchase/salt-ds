<LivePreview componentName="badge" exampleName="Default">
## Default

The `Badge` is anchored to the top-right corner when attached to a child component such as a button. As the number of alphanumeric characters increases, the badge width expands but stays in the same place.

### Best practices

Use a badge to summarize the overall state of the content the badge is anchored to. For example, you may want to provide a quick overview of the number of new or unread items.

<LivePreview componentName="badge" exampleName="InlineBadge">

## Inline badge

To place a badge inline instead of in the top-right corner of an element, don't pass `children` to the badge.

- Using a badge inline with text clarifies which part of the content the badge relates to.
- Highlight specific details within the content to draw the userâ€™s attention, such as using a badge inside a tab.

<LivePreview componentName="badge" exampleName="BadgeWithMaximumDigits">

## Badge with maximum digits

Specify the maximum displayed number with the `max` prop. If `value` exceeds `max`, it will clamp the value and append a (`+`) suffix.

- Without a `max` value, the component limits the value to three digits by default, displaying `999+` for any values over 999.

## Badge with string

The `value` property can accept both a `number` and a `string`. When you pass a string, the badge will not clamp the value.

<LivePreview componentName="badge" exampleName="DotBadge">

## Dot badge

A dot badge is a circular dot that notifies users of changes in state.

### Best practices

- Be consistent with the badge's position in a group of elements.
- If there is a 3:1 contrast between the badge and the element it is attached to, the badge can be anchored to the element's contents.
- If the icon graphic has number on the right top, don't anchor the badge directly to it to avoid blocking the number.

## Inline dot badge

Similarly to a regular badge, you can place a dot badge inline. To do this, do not pass `children` to the badge.
