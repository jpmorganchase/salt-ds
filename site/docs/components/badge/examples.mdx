## Default (top-right)

By default, `Badge` is in the top-right corner when attached to a child component such as an icon. Badges visually anchor to the attached component. As the number of alphanumeric characters increases, the badge width expands, but stays in the same place.

### Best practices

Use a badge in the top-right corner to summarize the overall state of the content the badge is anchored to. For example, you may want to provide a quick overview of the number of new or unread items, using numeric values.

## Inline badge

To place a badge inline instead of in the top-right corner of an element, don't pass `children` to the badge.

### Best practices

Using a badge inline with text clarifies which part of the content the badge relates to and allows specific details to be highlighted within the content to draw the user’s attention. For example, you may use a badge within `TabNext`, inline with the text.

## Badge with maximum digits

Specify the maximum displayed number with the `max` prop. If `value` exceeds `max`, it will clamp the value and append a (`+`) suffix.

When you don't pass a max value to the component, the value will have a limitation of three digits by default, displaying 999+ for any values over 999.

## Badge with string

The `value` property can accept both a `number` and a `string`.
