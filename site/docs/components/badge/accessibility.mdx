## Best practices

- When a badge is attached to a child component and that component receives focus, the focusable element should have an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute that describes the badge, such as "9 notifications."
- When the user navigates to an inline badge, the screen reader automatically announces the contents of the badge. Use `aria-label` to provide more context to the badge contents if needed.

## Accessibility 2.1 disclaimer

Please note that the dot badge indicator in dark mode falls slightly below the minimum contrast requirement of 3:1. This may impact the indicator visibility for users with visual impairments. This issue has been resolved in [Salt Next](/salt/themes/index#salt-next-theme).
