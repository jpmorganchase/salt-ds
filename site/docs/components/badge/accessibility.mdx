### Best practices

- When using a `Badge` that is attached to a child component that receives focus, the focusable element should have an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute that describes the badge e.g. "9 Notifications".
- When using a `Badge`, that is inline the badge is automatically announced by the screen reader when the user navigates to the element.
