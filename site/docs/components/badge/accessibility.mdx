### Best practises

#### Color usage

- If custom colours are used, consider the [minimum contrast guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) outlined in WCAG 2.1 documentation. The document recommends that the visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.

- We recommend only using the accent color for Badge. But for overrides, you should consider ADA where possible.
