### Best practices

- When a badge is attached to a child component and that component receives focus, the focusable element should have an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute that describes the badge, such as "9 notifications."
- When the user navigates to an inline badge, the screen reader automatically announces the contents of the badge. Use `aria-label` to provide more context to the badge contents if needed.
