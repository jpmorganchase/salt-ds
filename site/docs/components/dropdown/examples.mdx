### Dropdown

Dropdown contains a button that opens a list on mouse or keyboard interaction.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="dropdown" exampleName="Variants" >

### Variants

Dropdown has two variants: `primary` and `secondary`. The primary variant is set by default. Set to secondary with `variant=”secondary”`.

Choose secondary when used in a data-dense or compact interface, or for a form with multiple columns or sections.

The choice between primary and secondary variants should be considered alongside the background color it sits upon.

Tip: The [Forms pattern](/salt/patterns/forms) provides further guidance on primary versus secondary control selection.

<LivePreview componentName="dropdown" exampleName="DefaultSelected" displayName="Preselected value" >

### Preselected value

By default, the dropdown’s field is empty. When the `defaultSelected` prop is passed, the dropdown field displays the pre-selected value.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="dropdown" exampleName="Readonly" displayName="Read-only" >

### Read-only

Set Dropdown to read-only to allow values to be displayed that are predefined and not editable, for instance when a user does not have the appropriate permissions to select an option within the dropdown.

When `readOnly={true}` users will not be able to interact with dropdown apart from focusing on it.
Use to indicate that the pre-selected value is valid but changes are not permitted.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="dropdown" exampleName="Disabled" >

### Disabled

Dropdown can be disabled if required, for instance if the access to the options needs to be restricted based on the current context.

Unlike read-only, the disabled state can change for the current user depending on context. Showing it in a disabled state allows the user to be aware of the presence of the control, without enabling access to its functionality temporarily.

When `disabled={true}`, user will not be able to interact with dropdown, it does not receive focus on any interaction.
