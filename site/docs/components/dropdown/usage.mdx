## Using the component

### When to use

- When a user needs the ability to choose one value from a set of five to 10 options.
- When only the selected value from a set of options needs to be visible once the selection is made.

### When not to use

- When you have more than 10 options and users would benefit from filtering to narrow down the available options. Instead, use [`ComboBox`](../combo-box).
- When you have fewer than five options and need to one option to be selected. Instead, use [`RadioButtonGroup`](../button).
- When you have fewer than five options and multiple selections are required, or possible. Instead, use [`CheckboxGroup`](../checkbox).
- If you have a Boolean selection, for instance “on” or “off”. Instead, use [`Switch`](../switch).
- When you have large number (>100) of list items, to prevent performance issues without virtualization, we strongly recommend adding a filter e.g. use a [`ComboBox`](../combo-box) instead.

### Controlled/Uncontrolled

Just like native input elements in React, dropdowns can be controlled or uncontrolled. By default a dropdown is uncontrolled. Use the `defaultSelected` prop to control the default value of the dropdown.

If you want to control the value of the dropdown, use the `value` and `selected` props. The `onSelectionChange` prop is required when using the controlled approach.

## Import

To import `Dropdown` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Dropdown, Option, OptionGroup } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props

### `Dropdown`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Dropdown" />

### `Option`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Option" />

### `OptionGroup`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="OptionGroup" />
