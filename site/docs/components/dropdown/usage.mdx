### Using the component

#### When to use

- When a user needs the ability to choose one value from a set of five to 10 options.
- When only the selected value from a set of options needs to be visible once the selection is made.

#### When not to use

- When you have more than 10 options and users would benefit from filtering to narrow down the available options. Instead, use [`ComboBoxNext`](../combo-box).
- When you have fewer than five options and need to one option to be selected. Instead, use [`RadioButtonGroup`](../button).
- When you have fewer than five options and multiple selections are required, or possible. Instead, use [`CheckboxGroup`](../checkbox).
- If you have a Boolean selection, for instance “on” or “off”. Instead, use [`Switch`](../switch).
- When you have large number (>100) of list items, to prevent performance issues without virtualization, we strongly recommend adding a filter e.g. use a [`ComboBox`](../combo-box) instead.
