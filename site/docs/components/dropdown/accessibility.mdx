## Known accessibility issue

**Browser/Assistive Technology Combination Issue**: We have identified an accessibility issue when using Safari and VoiceOver that affects the usability of combo boxes. This issue is not related to our design system but is a known limitation in the interaction between these specific technologies and can be confirmed using the APG example on the w3c (Who created WCAG) which is the industry standard on accessibility.

**Issue Details**:

- Affected Components: Combobox (role=listbox)
- OS: MacOS 14.4.1+
- Browser: Safari v15+
- Assistive Technology: VoiceOver
- Issue Confirmed on: 10/8/24
- Problem: Focus is not managed correctly when using VoiceOver to select options from the combo box drop-down in Safari

**User Impact**:
VoiceOver users using Safari may experience difficulties when interacting with combo boxes across various websites and applications, not limited to those using our design system.

**Steps To Reproduce Using APG**:

1. Go to [APG Select-Only Combobox Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/examples/combobox-select-only/) using Safari
1. Turn on VoiceOver
1. Navigate to the example
1. Open the combo box using space/enter
1. Try to navigate and select an option.

Recommendations:

- Use Chrome or Firefox when possible
- Otherwise here is a workaround:
  1. Navigate to the example
  1. Open the combo box using space/enter
  1. VO key and right arrow to put VO focus on the dropdown
  1. VO key+shift and down arrow to go into the dropdown
  1. You should be able to navigate using right and left arrows with feedback
  1. VO key+space to make a selection.

We will continue to monitor this situation and update this note when the issue has been resolved.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is above the dropdown, Tab sets focus on the component. When focused, dropdown has a visible text cursor and the list is opened.
- If focus is on dropdown, Tab moves focus to the next focusable element in the tab order and selects the current active option.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is below the dropdown, this action sets focus on the component.
- If focus is on dropdown, this action moves focus to the previous focusable element in the tab order and selects the current active option.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space / Enter">

- If the list is open and focus is on a option that is not disabled, Enter makes a selection.
- If the dropdown is single-select, the list closes.
- If the dropdown is multi-select, the list remains open.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Escape">

- If the list is open, closes the list without making a selection, existing text in input field remains. Focus remains on dropdown.
- If the list is closed, does nothing. Focus remains on dropdown.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up arrow">

- If the list is open, moves visual focus to the previous option in the list. Focus does not wrap.
- If the list is closed, opens the list and moves visual focus to the last option in the list.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Down arrow">

- If the list is open, moves visual focus to the next option in the list. Focus does not wrap.
- If the list is closed, opens the list and moves visual focus to the first option in the list.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Home">

When focus is within the dropdown, Home moves focus to the first option.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="End">

When focus is within the dropdown, this action moves focus to the last option.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Page up">

When focus is within the dropdown, this action moves focus to the item before the first visible option.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Page down">

When focus is within the dropdown, this action moves focus to the item after the last visible option.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Printable Characters">

First opens the list if it is not already displayed and then moves visual focus to the first option that matches the typed character.

- If multiple keys are typed in quick succession, visual focus moves to the first option that matches the full string.
- If the same character is typed in succession, visual focus cycles among the options starting with that character.
