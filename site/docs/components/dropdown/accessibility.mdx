## Accessibility considerations

**Update 12/17/24**: This issue has been resolved in MacOS 15.

**Browser/Assistive Technology Combination Issue**: We have identified an accessibility issue when using Safari and VoiceOver that affects the usability of combo boxes. This issue isn't related to our design system but is a known limitation in the interaction between these specific technologies and can be confirmed using the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) (APG) example on the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) website](https://www.w3.org/). W3C created the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG), which is the industry standard on accessibility.

**Issue Details**:

- Affected Components: Combobox (role=listbox)
- OS: MacOS 14
- Browser: Safari v15+
- Assistive Technology: VoiceOver
- Issue Confirmed on: 10/8/24
- Problem: Focus is not managed correctly when using VoiceOver to select options from the combo box drop-down in Safari

**User Impact**:
VoiceOver users using Safari may experience difficulties when interacting with combo boxes across various websites and applications, not limited to those using our design system.

**Steps To Reproduce Using APG**:

1. Go to [APG Select-Only Combobox Example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/examples/combobox-select-only/) using Safari
1. Turn on VoiceOver
1. Navigate to the example
1. Open the combo box using space/enter
1. Try to navigate and select an option.

**Recommendations**:

- Use Chrome or Firefox, or update to MacOS 15.1+
- Otherwise here is a workaround:

1. Navigate to the example
1. Open the combo box using space/enter
1. VO key and right arrow to put VO focus on the dropdown
1. VO key+shift and down arrow to go into the dropdown
1. You should be able to navigate using right and left arrows with feedback
1. VO key+space to make a selection.
