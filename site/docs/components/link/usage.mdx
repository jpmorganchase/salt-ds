## Using the component

### When to use

- To provide navigation to a page on the same or different site.
- To link to documents, email addresses or phone numbers.
- To send users to a specific section on the same page.
- To provide users with more detailed information or assistance e.g., terms and conditions, help sections or contact information.

### When not to use

- To trigger an action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog. Instead, use [`Button`](../button).

## Content

- Link text should be concise, no longer than a single sentence. This helps to keep the user interface clean, minimize distractions and maintain a clear visual hierarchy.
- Do not overload sentences or pages with links.
- Consider writing standalone links as calls-to-action and begin with a verb e.g., “Visit the help page”.
- Write inline links as if they were part of the sentence.
- Do not include the word “link” in the link text. Most screen readers say “link” before each link.
- Link text should accurately describe the linked content. Link text that does not correctly reflect the destination or purpose can confuse or frustrate the user.

## Import
