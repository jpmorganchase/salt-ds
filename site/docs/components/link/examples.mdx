<LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Default">

## Default

By default, a link will only navigate the user within the same tab, replacing the page where the user followed the link.

</LivePreview>

  <LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="OpenInANewTab">

## Open in a new tab

Use `target=”_blank”` to open the target page in a new tab. A ‘tear-out’ icon that communicates this to the user will display next to the link.

Use the `IconComponent` prop to customize the icon. You can either provide an alternative icon, or the icon can be disabled by using `IconComponent={null}`. We only recommend disabling the icon when wrapping another component in a link, never for text-based links. This is because the icon helps the user identify when a link will take them to a new tab.

It is generally considered best practice to almost never open links in new tabs. Opening a link in a new tab is not expected default behavior for web browsers. It makes it harder to return to the previous page, especially for users of screen readers.

There are a few cases where it’s recommended, like when the link is in the middle of a form or multi-step process. This allows users to complete the action without losing their place on the original page.

### Security

When linking to third party content, we recommended setting `rel=”noopener”` or `rel=”noreferrer”`. Although this is default behaviour in newer browsers, explicitly specifying this helps protect users of legacy browsers. For more information, read “[Links to cross-origin destinations are unsafe](https://web.dev/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener/)”.

  <LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Color">

## Color

To help create a visual hierarchy using a link, use the `color` prop.

The default color is `primary`.

  </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Visited">

## Visited

Links change color after a user clicks on them. This tells the user which links they have already visited.

  </LivePreview>

  <LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Variant" displayName="Variant - Deprecated">

## Variant

**Note:** This prop is deprecated. Use the `color` prop instead.

To help create a visual hierarchy using a link, use the `variant` prop.
