## Default

By default, a link will only navigate the user within the same tab, replacing the page where the user followed the link.

<LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Default" />

## Open in a new tab

Use `target=”_blank”` to open the target page in a new tab. A ‘tear-out’ icon that communicates this to the user will display next to the link.

Use the `IconComponent` prop to customize the icon. You can either provide an alternative icon, or the icon can be disabled by using `IconComponent={null}`. We only recommend disabling the icon when wrapping another component in a link, never for text-based links. This is because the icon helps the user identify when a link will take them to a new tab.

It is generally considered best practice to almost never open links in new tabs. Opening a link in a new tab is not expected default behavior for web browsers. It makes it harder to return to the previous page, especially for users of screen readers.

There are a few cases where it’s recommended, like when the link is in the middle of a form or multi-step process. This allows users to complete the action without losing their place on the original page.

### Security

When linking to third party content, we recommended setting `rel=”noopener”` or `rel=”noreferrer”`. Although this is default behavior in newer browsers, explicitly specifying this helps protect users of legacy browsers. For more information, read “[Links to cross-origin destinations are unsafe](https://web.dev/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener/)”.

<LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="OpenInANewTab" />

## Color

To help create a visual hierarchy using a link, use the `color` prop. The default color is `primary`.

When `color` is set to `"inherit"` Link's hover, active and focus colors will also be inherited.

<LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Color" />

## Visited

Links change color after a user clicks on them. This tells the user which links they have already visited.

<LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Visited" />

## Underline

By default, links are underlined apart from hover state. If you need a more subtle effect, set `underline="never"`.

<LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Underline" />

## Render prop - element

Using the `render` prop, you can customize the element rendered by the Link. Props defined on the JSX element will be merged with props from the Link.

<LivePreview
  componentName="link"
  exampleName="RenderElement"
  displayName="Render prop - element"
/>

## Render prop - callback

The `render` prop can also accept a function. This approach allows more control over how props are merged, allowing for more precise customization of the component's behavior.

When a function is passed to the `render` prop, it's your responsibility to merge props within the function itself.

<LivePreview
  componentName="link"
  exampleName="RenderProp"
  displayName="Render prop - callback"
/>

## Variant

**Note:** This prop is deprecated. Use the `color` prop instead.

<LivePreview componentName="link" exampleName="Variant" />
