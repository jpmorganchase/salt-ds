- Screen reader users will use the Tab key to jump from link to link or pull up a list of links on a page. Avoid using the same link text to link to different content and ensure that links make sense out of context.
- When a link contains an icon and text, pass `aria-hidden=”true"` to the icon so that its label is not announced by screen readers.
- When a link has an icon and no text, pass an `aria-label` to the link to describe the content that the link leads to.
