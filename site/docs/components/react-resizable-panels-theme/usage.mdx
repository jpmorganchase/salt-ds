## Using the package

## Import

Make sure to install the React Resizable Panels package, `react-resizable-panels`.

To install the `@salt-ds/react-resizable-panels-theme` package, run the command appropriate to your environment: `yarn add @salt-ds/react-resizable-panels-theme` or `npm install @salt-ds/react-resizable-panels-theme`

### Import Salt React Resizable Panels theme

To import the Salt React Resizable Panels theme, use:

```js
import "@salt-ds/react-resizable-panels-theme/index.css";
```

Then wrap your React Resizable Panel Group with the `react-resizable-panels-theme-salt` class name:

```js
<div className="react-resizable-panels-theme-salt">
  <PanelGroup direction="horizontal">
    <Panel id="left">
      <Text>Left</Text>
    </Panel>
    <PanelResizeHandle />
    <Panel id="middle">
      <Text>Center</Text>
    </Panel>
    <PanelResizeHandle />
    <Panel id="right">
      <Text>Right</Text>
    </Panel>
  </PanelGroup>
</div>
```

## Customizing the appearance

To customize the appearance of panel resize handles and panels, follow these guidelines:

### Panel Resize Handles

- **Border Customization**: To add borders to the resize handles, apply the class `resize-handle-salt-border-<border>` to the `PanelResizeHandle` component. Replace `<border>` with the specific border side you want to style (e.g., `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`).

- **Background Color Customization**: To set the background color of the resize handles, use the class `resize-handle-salt-variant-<variant>`. Replace `<variant>` with the desired variant (`primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`) to match the corresponding Salt DS container background color. This ensures that the resize handles visually integrate with the theme's design.

### Panels

- **Background Color Customization**: For the panels themselves, apply the class `resizable-panel-salt-variant-<variant>` to the `Panel` component. Replace `<variant>` with the appropriate variant (`primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`) to set the panel's background color to the associated Salt DS container background color. This helps maintain a consistent and cohesive look across your application.

By using these class names, you can ensure that both the resize handles and panels are styled correctly, providing a seamless and visually appealing user interface.
