## Using the component

### When to use

- To organize content into two areas: a larger area, and a smaller area that controls the larger area.

### When not to use

- To position more than two layout items along a single dimension. Instead, use [`FlexLayout`](../flex), [`FlowLayout`](../flow), [`StackLayout`](../stack) or [`SplitLayout`](../split) depending on how you want to position them.
- To position more than two layout items in a grid. Instead, use [`GridLayout`](../grid).
