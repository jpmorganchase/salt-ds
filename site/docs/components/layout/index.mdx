  description: "`BorderLayout` manages the top-level layout of your application, website, or widget. It defines five distinct regions, with four surrounding a main content region. You can use them for elements such as a footer, header or side navigation. `BorderLayout` builds on top of `GridLayout`, and it's best to use it for entire website pages or application screens, where there's at least one additional region alongside the main area."
