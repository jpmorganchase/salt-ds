## Using the components

### When to use

- When it's best to display your content using a configurable number of columns and rows, such as a [form](/salt/patterns/forms) or a dashboard.
- For content regions where you display blocks or groups of content alongside each other, such as the main content area of the application, [`Dialog`](/salt/components/dialog), or [`Drawer`](/salt/components/drawer).
- When users will access the application or webpage across different viewport, screen or device sizes. `GridLayout` controls how to display the content and responsively organize across the different spaces, ensuring a reliable, usable experience.

### When not to use

- To define the high-level layout of your application surrounding the content area (i.e., header, footer, navigation areas. Instead, use [`BorderLayout`](../border).
- To lay out your content in a single dimension only, for example a horizontal summary bar containing a row of metric components, or a vertical stack of `Accordion` components. Instead, use [`StackLayout`](../stack), [`FlowLayout`](../flow) or [`FlexLayout`](../flex).

## Import

To import `GridLayout` and `GridItem` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { GridLayout, GridItem } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props

### `GridLayout`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="GridLayout" />

### `GridItem`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="GridItem" />

## References

`GridLayout` has a complementary layout grid style library for Figma. J.P. Morgan employees can enable the Salt Layout Grid library from the Assets panel. External designers can install the library from the [Salt community page](https://www.figma.com/@jpmorgan_salt).
