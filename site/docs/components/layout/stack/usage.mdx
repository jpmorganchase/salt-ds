## Using the component

### When to use

- When you need a layout that's consistently horizontal or vertical. If there isn't enough space in the main axis, scrolling the content is acceptable.
- For small-scale layouts within the application, such as a stack of cards or charts or a vertical side panel with visually distinct sections.
- To change the layout’s direction depending on breakpoints or add visual separation using the stack layout separators.

### When not to use

- Stack layouts will never wrap. If you want to create a layout in a row that responsively wraps over multiple lines, use [`FlowLayout`](../flow) instead.
- If you want the layout to have more complex customization. In this case, consider [`FlexLayout`](../flex).

## Import

To import `StackLayout` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { StackLayout } from "@salt-ds/core";
```
