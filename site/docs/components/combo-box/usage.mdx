## Using the component

### When to use

- To display and select from a list of 10 or more options that don't need to be permanently visible to the user without selecting from a dropdown menu.
- When only the selected value from a set of options needs to be visible once the selection is made.
- If a workflow benefits from having a filter to quickly narrow down the available options.
- If there are more than 100 options and you would like to prevent performance issues without virtualization.

### When not to use

- To choose one value from a set of five to ten options that does not require filtering. Instead, use [`Dropdown`](../dropdown).
- To select a single option from fewer than five. Instead, use [`RadioButtonGroup`](../radio-button).
- To select multiple options from fewer than five. Instead, use [`CheckboxGroup`](../checkbox).
- To make an instantaneous selection between two binary choices, for example “on” and “off”. Instead, use [`Switch`](../switch).

### Controlled/Uncontrolled

Just like native input elements in React, a combo box can be controlled or uncontrolled. By default a combo box is uncontrolled. Use the `defaultValue` and `defaultSelected` props to control the default value of the combo box.

If you want to control the value of the combo box, use the `value` and `selected` props. The `onSelectionChange` prop is required when using the controlled approach.

## Import

To import `ComboBox` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { ComboBox, Option, OptionGroup } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props

### `ComboBox`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="ComboBox" />

### `Option`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Option" />

### `OptionGroup`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="OptionGroup" />
