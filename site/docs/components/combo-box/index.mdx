  description: "`ComboBox` helps users to select an item from a large list of options without scrolling. The typeahead functionality makes this selection process quicker and easier, while reducing errors. Users see a list of options when they click on the component and then filter the list as they type. Once they’ve made a selection, it populates the field and the overlay list closes."
