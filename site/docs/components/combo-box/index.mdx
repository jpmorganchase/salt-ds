  description: "`ComboBox` helps users to select an item from a large list of options without scrolling. The typeahead functionality makes this selection process quicker, easier and reduces errors. Users can see a list of available options when they click on the component and then filter the list as they type. Once they’ve made their selection, it populates the field and the overlay list closes."
