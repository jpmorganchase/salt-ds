  description: "`ComboBoxNext` helps users to select an item from a large list of options without scrolling. The typeahead functionality makes this selection process quicker, easier and reduces errors. Users can see a list of available options when they click on the component and then filter the list as they type. Once theyâ€™ve made their selection, it populates the field and the overlay list closes."
