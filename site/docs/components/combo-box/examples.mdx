## Default (single-select)

A single item can be selected from the combo box options.

`ComboBox` contains an input field that opens a list. As users type, the list displays all filtered options based on their input.

### Best practices

- You can wrap `ComboBox` in a `FormField` when it’s displayed within a form context. This provides functionality built into Form Field for increased accessibility. For more information, refer to the [`FormField`](../form-field) guidance.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Default" />

## Multi-select

When `multiselect={true}`, users can select multiple items from the combo box options. Selected options are displayed as pills in the input field.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Multiselect" />

## Placeholder

You can use a placeholder to prompt user input if no default value is provided.

### Best practices

Never use placeholder text to provide the user with contextual help. It will be removed when the user starts typing and it does not meet minimum contrast requirements. Doing so is a WCAG failure.

Instead, use [`FormFieldHelperText`](/salt/components/form-field/examples#helper-text) beneath the field to provide instructions or directions which are necessary to complete the field, and reserve the placeholder text to support the help message, or provide an example of the suggested content.

More information can be found [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Placeholder" />

## Variants

The component has two variants: `primary` and `secondary`. The primary variant is set by default. Set to secondary with `variant=”secondary”`.

The choice between primary and secondary variants should be considered alongside the background color it sits upon.

### Best practices

The [forms pattern](/salt/patterns/forms) provides further guidance on primary versus secondary control selection. You can wrap `ComboBox` in a `FormField` when it’s displayed within a orm context. This provides functionality built into `FormField` for increased accessibility. For more information, refer to the [`FormField`](../form-field) guidance.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Variants" />

## Disabled

You can disable the combo box if required, for instance if the access to the options needs to be restricted based on the current context.

Unlike read-only, the disabled state can change for the current user depending on context. Showing it in a disabled state allows the user to be aware of the presence of the control, without enabling access to its functionality temporarily.

When `disabled={true}`, user will not be able to interact with combo box. It does not receive focus on any interaction.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Read-only

Set the combo box to read-only to allow values to be displayed that are predefined and not editable, for instance when a user does not have the appropriate permissions to select an option within the combo box.

When `readOnly={true}` users will not be able to interact with combo box apart from focusing on it.
Use to indicate that the pre-selected value is valid but changes are not permitted.

**Note:** ComboBox's role is changed to `"textbox"` when read-only is set to work around browser/screen reader limitations when conveying a read-only state.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Readonly" />

## Disabled option

Use the `disabled` prop on the `Option` component to disable an option. Disabled options are not selectable and are visually distinct from selectable options.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="DisabledOption" />

## `FormField` support

Wrap `ComboBox` in a [`FormField`](/salt/components/form-field) to make it accessible within a form. This will provide the combo box with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. More information can be found [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="WithFormField" />

## Grouped options

Wrap options in a `OptionGroup` component to group them together. Use the `label` prop to provide a label for the group.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Grouped" />

## Empty message

To display a message when there are no options available, pass your message as a child element with `role="option"`.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="EmptyMessage" />

## Complex options

You can supply static content as children to the `Option` component. This can be used to visually assist users, for example rendering the flag icons next to the name of countries or to provide descriptions for additional context as seen in this example.

### Best practices

- Users can benefit from seeing a particular visual with list items. Customize the display as you see fit. For example, if displaying a list of contacts, it may help to provide avatars alongside the option text.
- Place any visual support such as icons, country symbols or avatars to the left of the option text.
- Give users a quicker and easier experience when they’re choosing their options by changing the logic of the component’s typeahead filter.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="ComplexOptions" />

## Validation

`ComboBox` can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

### Best practices

- Use the error state to alert the user of a critical issue that’s related to the input. This issue, which may jeopardize completion of the task, usually requires action from the user to resolve the error.
- Display the warning state when you need to alert the user of a potential issue—that won’t prevent the user from continuing with the task, but may cause errors if it’s not addressed.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Validation" />

## Custom filtering

Due to its flexible API, you can customize the filtering logic `ComboBox` uses to suit your needs. In this example it displays the entire list of options when the combo box opens due to a mouse click.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="CustomFiltering" />

## Server side data

You can use `ComboBox` to display data from a server. In this example, a list of states is fetched from a JSON file and filtered on the client side.

Note that the data fetching in this example has been made intentionally slow to highlight the loading states.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="ServerSideData" />

## Object values

In order to support advanced use-cases, like where the options are fetched from a server, the `value` prop passed to `Option` can be an object.
When the `value` prop is an object, the `valueToString` prop must be provided to `ComboBox` to specify how to display the option in the input field.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="ObjectValues" />

## Truncation

Use the `truncate` prop when you are limited on space and want to prevent the multi-select combobox from spanning multiple lines.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Truncation" />

## Select on Tab

Use the `selectOnTab` prop to select the active option from the list on Tab key press.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="SelectOnTab" />

## Clear Selection

In order to clear all the selections, you can pass a [`Button`](../button) to the `endAdornment` prop of the `ComboBox`.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="ClearSelection" />

**Note:** To prevent the clear selection action from triggering a blur event, you can add `event.stopPropagation()` to your event handler. e.g.

```tsx
const handleClear = (event: any) => {
  if (!event.currentTarget?.contains(event.relatedTarget)) {
    event.stopPropagation();
  }
  ...
}
```

## Bordered

To style `ComboBox` with a full border, set `bordered={true}`.

We recommend this styling when the field uses the same fill color as the background (i.e., a primary fill color on a primary background).

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Bordered" />

## Free Text

If users need to select an option not in a predefined list, use a controlled `ComboBox` and add an `Option` to the bottom of the list matching the typed-in text.

This functionality allows users to input information that might not be covered by the provided choices, offering flexibility and accommodating diverse responses.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="FreeText" />

## OverlayProps

Use `OverlayProps` to pass props to the overlay that is rendered when the combo box is open. For example, you can set a maximum height for the overlay.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="OverlayProps" />

## Delimiter character

In some cases, you may want to enable users to select multiple options by typing a delimiter character. This can be by using a controlled `ComboBox` and the `onPaste` event handler.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Delimiter" />
