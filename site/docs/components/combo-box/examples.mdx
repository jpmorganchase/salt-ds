### Default (single select)

A single item can be selected from the combo box options.

Combo Box contains an input field that opens a list. As users' type, the list displays all filtered options based on the user’s input.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="CustomRenderer" >

### Custom renderer

Customize the list item display to visually assist users, for example rendering the flag icons next to the name of countries as seen in this example. Use the `ListItem` prop to customize list items.

Guidance:

- Users can benefit from seeing a particular visual with list items. Customize the display as you see fit. For example, if displaying a list of contacts, it may help to provide headshots alongside the option text.
- Place any visual support such as icons, country symbols or avatars to the left of the option text.

Define a filter that only matches the first letter of a word. Use the `itemFilter` prop to customize the filter that applies to the elements.

Guidance:

- Give users a quicker and easier experience when they’re choosing their options by changing the logic of the component’s typeahead filter.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Variants" >

### Variants

Combo Box has two variants: `primary` and `secondary`. The primary variant is set by default. Set to secondary variant with `variants=”secondary”`.

Guidance:

- Use the secondary variant when in a data-dense or compact interface, or for a form with multiple columns or sections.
- When deciding which variant to use, consider the background color of the application.
- Tip: The [Forms pattern](/salt/patterns/forms) provides further guidance on primary versus secondary control selection. Combo box can be wrapped in a Form Field when it’s displayed within a Form context. This provides functionality built into Form Field for increased accessibility. For more information, refer to the [Form Field](../form-field) guidance.

<LivePreview componentName="combo-box" exampleName="Disabled" >

### Disabled

When `disabled={true}`, users will not be able to interact with Combo Box and it does not receive focus on any interaction.

Guidance:

- Disable combo box if you need to restrict access to options based on the current context.
- Showing combo box in a disabled state makes the user aware of the control without enabling access to its functionality.
