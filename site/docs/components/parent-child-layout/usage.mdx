### Using the component

#### When to use

- To organize content into two areas: a larger area, and a smaller area that controls the larger area.

#### When not to use

- To position more than two layout items along a single dimension. Instead, use [`FlexLayout`](../components/flex-layout), [`FlowLayout`](../components/flow-layout/), [`StackLayout`](../components/stack-layout) or [`SplitLayout`](../components/split-layout) depending on how you want to position them.
- To position more than two layout items in a grid. Instead, use [`GridLayout`](../components/grid-layout/).
