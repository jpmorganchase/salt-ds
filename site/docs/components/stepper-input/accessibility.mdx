## Best practices

- Wrap `StepperInput` in [`FormField`](/salt/components/form-field) to provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. This will ensure it complies with accessibility guidelines. You can find more information [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).
- `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemax`, and `aria-valuemin` attributes are set to provide users with information about the current value, and the allowable range of values.

## Keyboard interactions

Stepper input inherits keyboard interactions from [`Input`](/salt/components/input/accessibility).

The following interactions are specific to Stepper Input.

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up Arrow">

When the input area has focus:

- Increases the number by the increment value, up to the maximum value if set.
- If the Up Arrow key is held down, it continues to increase the number by the increment value at a constant rate, after a 300ms delay.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Down Arrow">

When the input area has focus:

- Decresase the number by the increment value, up to the minimum value if set.
- If the Down Arrow key is held down, it continues to decrease the number by the increment value at a constant rate, after a 300ms delay.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Up Arrow">
 
When the input area has focus:

- Increases the number by the block value, up to the maximum value if set.
- If the Page Up key is held down, it continues to increase the number by the block value at a constant rate, after a 300ms delay.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Down Arrow">
 
When the input area has focus:

- Decreases the number by the block value, up to the maximum value if set.
- If the Page Down key is held down, it continues to decrease the number by the block value at a constant rate, after a 300ms delay.
