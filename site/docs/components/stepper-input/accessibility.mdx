## Best practices

Wrap `StepperInput` in [`FormField`](/salt/components/form-field) to provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. This will ensure it complies with accessibility guidelines. You can find more information [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

## Keyboard interactions

Stepper input inherits keyboard interactions from [`Input`](/salt/components/input/accessibility).

The following interactions are specific to Stepper Input.

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up arrow">

When the input area has focus, Up arrow increases the number by the increment value (default to 1), up to the maximum value if set.

</KeyboardControl>
