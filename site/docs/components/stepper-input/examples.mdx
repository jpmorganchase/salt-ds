## Default

- `Stepper Input` comprises an [`Input`](salt/components/input) component with a default numerical value and stepper buttons. Once it has focus, it accepts numerical characters.
- The default `Stepper Input` has a `defaultValue` of 0, `step` of 1 and `block` of 10.

### Best practices

- Pick a default value that reflects the desired value for most users.

<LivePreview componentName="stepper-input" exampleName="Limits" >

## Limits

- By default users can enter a number within the bounds of the maximum and minimum floating-point number.
- If you need to limit the range of accepted values, you can set the `min` and/or `max` props.
- The respective up or down buttons will be disabled when at the limit, and users will not be able to exceed them via keyboard controls.

### Best practices

- Clearly state the accepted value range in the [`Form Field's`](salt/components/form-field) helper text.
- Use the [`Form Field's`](salt/components/form-field) error state to inform users if they have manually typed in a value outside of the accepted range.

## Step and Block

- You can customize the amount the value is changed by when pressing the buttons or arrow keys with the `step` prop.
- Holding down the Shift key when pressing Up Arrow or Down Arrow keys applies a block multiplier to the step. You can customize this multiplier with the `block` prop.

### Best practices

- Select a `step` value that aligns with the precision required by the use case.
- Set the `block` value to a reasonable multiple of the step value, allowing users to make larger adjustments.

<LivePreview componentName="stepper-input" exampleName="Decimals" >

## Decimals

- `Stepper Input` accepts no decimal places by default. Use the `decimalPlaces` prop to allow the user to enter a value with decimal places.

### Best practices

- Adjust the `step` and `block` values to align with the decimal use case.

<LivePreview componentName="stepper-input" exampleName="CustomButtons" >

## Custom buttons

- Hide the default stepper buttons with the `hideButtons` prop if you wish to customize the appearance of the controls.
- Ensure you provide alternative controls for adjusting the value to maintain usability and accessibility.

### Best practices

- Place alternative controls close to the Stepper Input, or place them inside the input field via the `endAdornment` and `startAdornment` props.
- Ensure that buttons have useful aria-labels.

<LivePreview componentName="stepper-input" exampleName="Refresh" >

## Refresh

- You can add a refresh button inside the input field via the `endAdornment` or `startAdornment` props.
- Use this when you want users to be able to revert to the default value.

### Best practices

- Ensure the button has a relevant aria-label.
