### Best practices

When building a page layout, it is important to make sure you use semantic HTML, which means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

The Grid Layout and Grid Item components support this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.

```tsx
<GridLayout as="footer">
  <GridItem as="p">Lorem Ipsum</GridItem>
  <GridItem as="a" href="mailto:loremipsum@example.com">
    loremipsum@example.com
  </GridItem>
</GridLayout>
```
