## Best practices

When building a page layout, apply semantic HTML. This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

The `GridLayout` and `GridItem` components support this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.

```tsx
<GridLayout as="footer">
  <GridItem as="p">Lorem Ipsum</GridItem>
  <GridItem as="a" href="mailto:loremipsum@example.com">
    loremipsum@example.com
  </GridItem>
</GridLayout>
```
