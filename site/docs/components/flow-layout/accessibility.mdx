### Best practices

When building a sub-section of a page using a flow layout, it's important to use semantic HTML, which means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

Flow layouts support this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.

```tsx
<FlowLayout as="nav">
  <FlexItem as="a" href="#">
    Link
  </FlexItem>
</FlowLayout>
```
