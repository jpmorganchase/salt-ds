## Best practices

When building a sub-section of a page using a flow layout, apply semantic HTML, This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

Flow layouts support this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.

```tsx
<FlowLayout as="nav">
  <FlexItem as="a" href="#">
    Link
  </FlexItem>
</FlowLayout>
```
