title: Flow Layout
data:
  description: Flow Layout displays items in a horizontal order and wraps them onto a subsequent row if they donâ€™t fit within the defined width. It is built on top of the Flex Layout component and is specifically intended for small-scale layouts where components need to be displayed in a responsive row, such as a row of metrics or a filter bar where fields can wrap over multiple lines. For additional control of the size and position of content, use Flex Item for each content item inside Flow Layout.

  # Fill in the info from the content template's "Metadata" table below.
  # To omit optional items, comment them out with #
