title: Flow layout
data:
  description: "`FlowLayout` displays items in a horizontal order and wraps them onto a subsequent row if they donâ€™t fit within the defined width. It builds on top of the `FlexLayout` component and is best for small-scale layouts where you need to display components in a responsive row, such as a row of metrics or a filter bar where fields can wrap over multiple lines. For additional control of the size and position of content, use `FlexItem` for each content item inside a flow layout."
