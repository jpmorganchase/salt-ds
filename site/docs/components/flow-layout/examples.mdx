<LivePreview componentName="flow-layout" exampleName="Default">

## Default

A flow layout displays items in a row that will responsively wrap onto a new line.

By default, items will stretch across the layout, with a `gap` between items of 3, which is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing).

The height and width of the layout area depend on the items contained within it.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="flow-layout" exampleName="LayoutPosition">

## Layout position

Control the position of the flow layout and its items using `align` and `justify` props.

Use `justify` to define how to distribute any remaining space between or at the ends of items in the row.

If there's additional space available above or below the row, use the `align` property to define the position of items within that space.

<LivePreview componentName="flow-layout" exampleName="FlexItemPosition">

## Flex item position

Use the flex item `align` prop to set an alignment for a specific item in the layout.

Set the itemâ€™s position along the cross axis of the layout (i.e., perpendicular to the row).

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="flow-layout" exampleName="FlexItemSize">

## Flex item size

The flex item `grow` prop enables specific items in the layout to grow and fill any remaining space in the row:

- By default, `grow` is 0 and items will be in their "normal" size.
- If you set an item to 1, it will fill the available space.
- If you set an item to 2, it will fill twice as much space as other items that have `grow` set to 1.

In contrast to `grow`, `shrink` makes a specific item as small as possible within the row. By default, `shrink` is 1. If you set an item to 2, it will attempt to take half as much space.
