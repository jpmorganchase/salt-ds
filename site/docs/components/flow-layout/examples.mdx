### Default

Flow Layout displays items in a row which will responsively wrap onto a new line.

By default, items will stretch across the layout, with a `gap` between items of 3, which is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing).

The height and width of the layout area are driven by the items contained within it.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="flow-layout" exampleName="LayoutPosition">

### Layout position

Control the position of Flow Layout and its items using `align` and `justify` props.

Use `justify` to define how to distribute any remaining space between or at the ends of items in the row.

If there is additional space available above or below the row, use the `align` property to define how items should be positioned within that space.

### Flex Item position

Use the Flex Item `align` prop to set an alignment for a specific item in the layout.

Set the item’s position along the cross-axis of the layout (i.e., perpendicular to the row).

<LivePreview componentName="flow-layout" exampleName="FlexItemSize">

### Flex Item size

The Flex Item `grow` prop enables specific items in the layout to grow and fill any remaining space in the row:

- By default, `grow` is set to 0 and items will be displayed in their ‘normal’ size.

- If an item is set to ‘1’ it will fill the available space.

- If an item is set to ‘2’ it will fill twice as much space as other items that have `grow` set to ‘1’.

#### Guidance

- In contrast to `grow`, `shrink` makes a specific item as small as possible within the row. By default, `shrink` is set to `1`. If an item is set to `2`, that item will attempt to take half as much space.
