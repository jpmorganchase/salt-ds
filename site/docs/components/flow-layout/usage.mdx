## Using the component

### When to use

- To build responsive layouts that wrap across multiple rows when there isn't enough space in the viewport.
- For small-scale layouts within the application, such as a card in a dashboard displaying metrics or a header bar containing filter controls.

### When not to use

- A flow layout will always wrap. If you want to create a layout in a row that doesnâ€™t wrap, use [`StackLayout`](/salt/components/stack-layout).
- If you want the layout to have more complex customization. In this case, we recommend [`FlexLayout`](/salt/components/flex-layout).

## Import

To import `FlowLayout` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { FlowLayout } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="FlowLayout" />
