### When to use Flow Layout

- When you want to build responsive layouts that will wrap across multiple rows as soon as there is not enough space on the viewport.

- For small-scale layouts within the application, such as a card in a Dashboard displaying metrics or a header bar containing filter controls.

### When not to use Flow Layout

- Flow Layout will always wrap. If you want to create a layout in a row that doesnâ€™t wrap, use [Stack Layout](/salt/components/stack-layout).

- You want the layout to have more complex customization. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Flex Layout](/salt/components/flex-layout).

### Import

To import Flow Layout from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { FlowLayout } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="FlowLayout" />
