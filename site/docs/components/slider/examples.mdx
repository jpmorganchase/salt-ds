<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="Single">

## Single

Selection of a single value from a slider track. Labels can be displayed either inline or below the track.

A tooltip displays the value of the slider "thumb" when the thumb is focused or hovered. The tooltip remains persistent on cursor drag or moving the thumb along the track with keyboard interaction.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="Range">

## Range

Selection of a range of values from a slider track. This determines a minimum and maximum range. Values can be displayed either inline or below the track. Thumbs cannot pass or overlap.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="CustomStep">

## Custom step

By default, the slider step increment is set to 1. This can be customized by using the ‘step’ prop.

Custom step values can be set to any number, including decimal values up to two decimal places.

If a custom step value is provided that is not a multiple of the range, the slider will round the maximum selectable value to the largest multiple of the step that is less than the maximum value. **Note:** This will render the final portion of the slider track inaccessible by keyboard navigation but still draggable by pointer (the portion between the rounded maximum value and the actual maximum value). Step calculations are made from `0`, so the same rounding logic applies to negative values, but in the opposite direction.

### Best practices

- Use a step value that is a multiple of the range to ensure the entire range is selectable.
- Use a step value that is relative to the granularity of the scale to prevent tedious slider selections.

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="WithFormatting">

## With formatting

You can pass a callback function to the `format()` prop to format the display values in the tooltip and min/max labels. This can be useful to display units or currency.

### Best practices

- When formatting the values, it is recommended to add the same formatting to the markers if passed.

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="WithFormFieldSingle">

## With form field (single slider)

Wrap single slider in a form field to display a left-aligned or top label. For more information, refer to the [form field documentation.](/salt/components/form-field/examples)

### Best practices

We recommend using labels with slider to provide context and aid the user in understanding the value being selected.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="WithFormFieldRange">

## With form field (range slider)

Wrap range slider in a form field to display a left-aligned or top label. For more information, refer to the [form field documentation.](/salt/components/form-field/examples)

### Best practices

We recommend using labels with range slider to provide context and aid the user in understanding the value being selected.

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="WithInput">

## With input

You can display inputs with either a single or range slider. Inputs are used to enter a numeric value from the predefined range, enabling the thumb to jump to the specified value.

"Out of range" changes to the value (i.e. setting the input to a value above or below the slider's `min` and `max` values) will be rounded to the nearest valid value for the slider. When using a range slider, the upper and lower values cannot overlap (i.e. the lower value cannot be set to a value higher than the upper value). If the input value is set to a value that would cause an overlap, the range value will be set to the nearest valid value.

### Best practices

- For single slider, display one input to the left of the track.
- When using inputs, ensure the slider is in "controlled" mode (by explicitly setting the `value` prop).
- Use the slider's `onChange` callback to update the input values when the slider is interacted with.
- Validate your input value changes and update the `validationStatus` prop on any inputs accordingly.
- For single slider, display one input to the left of the track.
- Only use the inline variant of slider alongside an input. This ensures the size-base alignment of the overall component layout is maintained.

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="WithMarkers">

## With Markers

You can display markers under the values of your choice with custom labels.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="WithCustomLabels">

## With Custom Min/Max labels

You can customize the min and max labels.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="slider" exampleName="WithNonNumericValues">

## With Non Numeric values

You can implement a slider that allows users to select non-numeric values, with a focus on accessibility through the use of `aria-valuetext`.

The slider maps numeric values to meaningful non-numeric options, enabling intuitive selection beyond simple numbers. The `aria-valuetext` attribute is dynamically updated to announce the selected option, providing clear feedback for users with assistive technologies. Each option is marked on the slider, offering visual guidance on available selections.

### Best practices:

- State Management: Utilizes useState to track the selected option.

- Dynamic Labels: Converts numeric values to descriptive labels for both display and accessibility.

- Markers: Configured to visually represent each option on the slider track.

This approach ensures a user-friendly and accessible interface for selecting non-numeric values.

## Disabled slider

You can set the slider as disabled
