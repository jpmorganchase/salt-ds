## Using the component

### When to use

- When selecting a single value, range of numeric values or relative scale.
- When the exact value does not matter (depending on the size of the predefined range), but an approximate value is good enough.
- When changes are applied for immediate feedback, e.g., changing the volume on an audio or video player.

### When not to use

- When itâ€™s important to select an exact numeric value that falls within a significantly large range, for example, 1-1000. Instead, use [Input](/salt/components/input).
- When displaying progress through a series of separate steps, such as a wizard or multistep form. Use [SteppedTracker 
](/salt/components/stepped-tracker) instead.

### Tooltip

A tooltip displays the value of a handle when the handle is focused or hovered. The tooltip remains persistent on cursor drag or moving the handle along the track with keyboard interaction. By default, tooltip is configured to flip to switch placement sides if constrained by space, so that it remains visible.
