## Using the component

### When to use

- When selecting a single value, range of numeric values or relative scale.
- When the exact value does not matter (depending on the size of the predefined range), but an approximate value is good enough.
- When changes are applied for immediate feedback, e.g., changing the volume on an audio or video player.

### When not to use

- When itâ€™s important to select an exact numeric value that falls within a significantly large range, for example, 1-1000. Instead, use [Input](/salt/components/input).
- When displaying progress through a series of separate steps, such as a wizard or multistep form. Use [Stepper](/salt/components/stepper) instead.
