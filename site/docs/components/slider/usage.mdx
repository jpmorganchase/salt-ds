## Using the component

### When to use

- When selecting a single value, range of numeric values or relative scale.
- When the exact value does not matter (depending on the size of the predefined range), but an approximate value is good enough.
- When changes are applied for immediate feedback, e.g., changing the volume on an audio or video player.

### When not to use

- When itâ€™s important to select an exact numeric value that falls within a significantly large range, for example, 1-1000. Instead, use Input.
- When displaying progress through a series of separate steps, such as a wizard or multistep form. Use Stepped tracker instead.

### Content

Display labels as numbers so they remain as short as possible and don't overlap with each other or with the Slider. If labels are overlapping, adjust the Slider width and/or number of visible inrcrements.
