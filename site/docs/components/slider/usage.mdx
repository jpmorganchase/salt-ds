## Using the component

By default, the slider step increment is set to 1. This can be customised by configuring the ‘step’ prop. We recommend using an increment most suitable to your use case by using a step relative to the granularity of the scale. This prevents slider selections from becoming tedious and difficult to manage.

### When to use

When selecting a single value, range of numeric values or relative scale.
When the exact value does not matter (depending on the size of the predefined range), but an approximate value is good enough.
When changes are applied for immediate feedback, e.g., changing the volume on an audio or video player.

### When not to use

When it’s important to select an exact numeric value that falls within a significantly large range, for example, 1-1000. Instead, use Input.
When displaying progress through a series of separate steps, such as a wizard or multistep form. Use Stepped tracker instead.

### Content

Keep labels short and concise by limiting to a single line of text.
Labels should not obstruct the view of the track or handle.
