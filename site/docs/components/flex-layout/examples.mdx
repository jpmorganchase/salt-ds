<LivePreview componentName="flex-layout" exampleName="Default">

### Default

By default, `FlexLayout` displays items along the horizontal axis in a row, aligned to the start of the container. The spacing between items is driven by the property `gap`, which is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing) and is set to 3. The dimensions of the layout (height or width) are driven by the items contained within it.

#### Best practices

Set `wrap={true}` to overflow items onto subsequent rows when they no longer fit in the container.

### Column direction

The flex layout `direction` prop defines the main axis that items are displayed along. Set `direction` to `column` to display items in a vertical direction.

<LivePreview componentName="flex-layout" exampleName="LayoutPosition">

### Layout position

Control the position of the flex layout and its items using the `align` and `justify` props.

Use `justify` to define how to distribute any remaining space between or around all of the items along the main-axis of the flex layout (i.e., along the row or column).

If there is additional space available in the cross-axis of the layout (i.e., beside a row, or above/below a column), the `align` prop defines how items should be positioned within that space.

### Responsive layout

Flex layouts support responsive props, so you can define different behaviors based on viewport size (e.g., switching `direction` with screen size). You can use the default [Salt breakpoints](/salt/foundations/responsiveness#breakpoints) or pass in your own using `SaltProvider`.

A responsive prop is a prop that takes either multiple values (one value per breakpoint), or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes. For example, a layout that will responsively change direction from row to column at specific breakpoints or viewport sizes:

```js
direction={{ xs: "row", sm: "column", lg: "row", md: "column", xl: "row" }}
```

### Flex item position

Use the flex item's `align` prop to set an alignment for a specific item in the layout. Use the `align` prop to set the item’s position along the cross-axis of the layout (i.e., perpendicular to the `direction`–`row` or `column`).

<LivePreview componentName="flex-layout" exampleName="FlexItemSize">

### Flex item size

The flex item's `grow` prop enables specific items in the layout to grow and fill any remaining space that is available in the layout:

- By default, `grow` is set to 0 and items will be displayed in their ‘normal’ size.
- If an item is set to `1` it will fill the available space.
- If an item is set to `2` it will fill twice as much space as other items that have `grow` set to `1`.

In contrast to the `grow` prop, the `shrink` prop makes a specific item as small as possible within the layout. By default, `shrink` is set to `1`. If an item is set to `2`, that item would attempt to take half as much space.
