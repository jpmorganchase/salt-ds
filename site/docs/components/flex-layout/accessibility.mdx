## Best practices

When building a layout for part of a page using `FlexLayout`, apply semantic HTML, which means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

`FlexLayout` and `FlexItem` components support this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `“div”`.

```tsx
<FlexLayout as="ol" direction="column">
  <FlexItem as="li">List item</FlexItem>
</FlexLayout>
```
