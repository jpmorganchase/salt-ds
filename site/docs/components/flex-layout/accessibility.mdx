When building a layout for part of a page using Flex Layout, it is important to make sure you use semantic HTML, which means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

Flex Layout and Flex Item components support this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `“div”`.

```tsx
<FlexLayout as="ol" direction="column">
  <FlexItem as="li">List item</FlexItem>
</FlexLayout>
```
