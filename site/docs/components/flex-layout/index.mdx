title: Flex layout
data:
  description: "`FlexLayout` controls the direction, size and position of items displayed in a UI container. Use when the direction needs complex customization that can't be achieved by `StackLayout`, `FlowLayout` or `SplitLayout`. For additional control of the size and position of content, use `FlexItem` for each content item inside `FlexLayout`."
