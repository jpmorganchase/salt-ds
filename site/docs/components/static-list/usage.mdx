## Using the component

### When to use

- To present a set of static list items. It can be used with a [`FileDropZone`](/salt/components/file-drop-zone) to show the list of files added. It can also be used to create a shopping cart list.

### When not to use

- If you need to create an interactive list, use the [`ListBox`](../list-box) component.

## Content

- Always use sentence case for static list item labels.
- Keep static list item labels short and concise.
- Keep static list secondary item labels short and concise.

## Import

To import `StaticList` and related components from the lab Salt package, use:

```
import { StaticList, StaticListItem, StaticListItemContent } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```
