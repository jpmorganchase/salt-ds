## Using the components

### When to use

- When you have to provide feedback or indicate your level of satisfaction with a product, service, or experience.

### When not to use

- When you have fewer than 3 increments (such as a binary thumbs up/down or like/dislike) do not provide enough nuance for most rating scenarios. In this scenario, use a [`ToggleButtonGroup`](../toggle-button).

To import `Rating` from the lab Salt package, use:

```js
import { Rating } from "@salt-ds/lab";
