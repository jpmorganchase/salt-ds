## Using the component

### When to use

- When you have to provide feedback or indicate your level of satisfaction with a product, service, or experience.
- When there are at least 3 increments—this allows users to express a basic range of sentiment (poor, average, good).

### When not to use

- When there are fewer than 3 increments (such as a binary thumbs up/down or like/dislike) the component doesn’t offer enough nuance for most rating scenarios. In this scenario, use a [`ToggleButtonGroup`](../toggle-button).
- When there are more than 10 increments and users need to select an option, use a [`ComboBox`](../combo-box).

### Content

- Label text should always be on one line.
- Labels have no character limit, however a maximum of 30 characters is recommended before truncation.
