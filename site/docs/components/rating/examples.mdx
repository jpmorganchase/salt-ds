## Basic

The default Rating configuration displays five increments, as stars, from which users can select a rating.

<LivePreview componentName="rating" exampleName="Basic" />

## Clear Selection

When using Rating as part of a form—for example, in a customer survey—and the field isn’t mandatory for successful submission, you can allow the user to clear their previous entry by selecting a new rating. To configure this, use the allowClear prop.

<LivePreview componentName="rating" exampleName="ClearSelection" />

## Visual Label

You can display Rating with a aligned label. This alignment is particularly useful when your application’s vertical real estate is limited.

**Note:** Label position: The label can be positioned top, right, bottom or left of the Rating component. The default label position is ‘right’. The application can define the semantic value of each icon; it could also be a numerical value (e.g., 1/5 - 5/5)

<LivePreview componentName="rating" exampleName="VisualLabel" />

## Form Field Support

If the component is wrapped in a Form Field and you need to provide additional guidance, you can display help text beneath the rating.

**Note:** Rating (and optional label) are vertically centred inside a Form Field control area with --size-base height.

<LivePreview componentName="rating" exampleName="WithFormField" />

## Custom Icons

You can display up to 10 increments, reducing or increasing the number to suit your particular use case. To configure the number of increments, use the max prop.

**Note:** There should be at least 3 increments—this allows users to express a basic range of sentiment - 
Poor/ Unsatisfactory
Average/Neutral
Good/Satisfactory
Fewer than 3 increments (such as a binary thumbs up/down or like/dislike) do not provide enough nuance for most rating scenarios.
In this scenario, use a Toggle Button Group.
10 increments is the recommended maximum for highly detailed feedback but can be overwhelming, and is unnecessary for most scenarios.

### Best practice
Display the same number of increments across all Rating components within your application to ensure that the value of each increment remains consistent for users.

<LivePreview componentName="rating" exampleName="CustomIcons" />

### Disabled

You can disable Rating if required, e.g., due to context or user permissions. Showing the component in a disabled state indicates its presence and functionality which may become available.

**Note:** In a disabled state, the component is not considered relevant to the user flow and does not need to meet accessibility criteria for 3:1 minimum contrast.

<LivePreview componentName="rating" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Read-only

Display Rating in a read-only state when you need to communicate the current rating, and prevent it from being edited. A rating in a read-only state will be submitted with the corresponding form.

**Note:** A read-only state is typically used to display a single user’s, or an aggregate, rating for a product, service, page, or other entity (non-interactive)
