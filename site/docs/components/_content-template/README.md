# How to use the component page content template

To provide the necessary documentation for a UI component, please:

1. Make a copy of [`index.mdx`](./index.mdx) into the [`components/` directory](../) and rename it to your component's name in kebab case. For example `form-field.mdx`.
1. Fill in the sections
   - Pay attention to the `<!-- ... -->` comments in each section, which explain what is required for each.
