# Component Name

## Overview

<!--
  Live component demo here of the default/most common usage.

  For live demos in Storybook use:

  <Canvas>
    <Story id="..." />
  </Canvas>
-->

<!--
  Introductory text that briefly explains the purpose of the component and
  anything else of note.
-->

## Configurations

<!--
  A visual list of possible configurations of the component.

  The purpose is to convey the main features and/or usage options of the
  component (e.g. the Data Grid's striped rows might be a "configuration" to
  showcase here). The configurations listed here should aim to be comprehensive,
  but not necessarily exhaustive (some complex components may have vast numbers
  of possible permutations, so listing out each one would be impossible and
  overwhelming to readers).

  Each confguration should have its own section following the structure outlined
  below:
-->

### Configuration title (e.g. Striped rows)

<!--
  A brief description of what this configuration provides to users and when it
  should be used.
-->

<!--
  A live example of the component configuration, with access to the correspoding
  source code.

  In Storybook this is done using something like:

  <Canvas>
    <Story id="..." />
  </Canvas>
-->

## Usage

### When not to use Component Name

<!--
  Bulleted list of scenarios where this component is not appropriate. Where
  possible, include a link to an alternative component that should be used in
  it's place
-->

### Content

<!--
  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  Add any component-specific content guidance here, use visual examples where
  appropriate.

  For example, a Button component might include guidance on recommended terms to
  use for the label text, recommended maximum character counts, etc.
-->

### Accessibility

<!--
  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  Describe any considerations the users may need to take into account when using
  the component. For example:

  - Accessibility decisions that deviate from industry standard. (e.g., we've
    introduced an arrow key navigation, where usually is only tab).
  - Accessibility requirements that drive design (e.g., how multi-column forms
    should wrap).
  - Best practices regarding accessible content (e.g., error message
    announcements must not rely on descriptions that require the user to
    visually or audibly perceive content).
  - Best practices regarding implementation (e.g., to make sure this component
    is accessible be sure to provide a relevant alt text).
-->

  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  If there are industry best practices, principles or standards for this
  component, list them in this section. Include links out to useful articles.

## Styling

### Anatomy

<!--
  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  A visual anatomy diagram that shows the key parts or nested components that
  this component is made up of. They should be annotated with numbered badges in
  the diagram and a numbered list below the image should provide the names or
  explanations for each part.
