  usage.

  For screenshots use Markdown:

<!--
  Introductory text that briefly explains the purpose of the component and
  anything else of note.

## When not to use Component Name

## Configurations

<!--
  A visual list of possible configurations of the component.

  The purpose is to convey the main features and/or usage options of the
  component (e.g. the Data Grid's striped rows might be a "configuration" to
  showcase here). The configurations listed here should aim to be comprehensive,
  but not necessarily exhaustive (some complex components may have vast numbers
  of possible permutations, so listing out each one would be impossible and
  overwhelming to readers).

  Each confguration should have its own section following the structure outlined
  below:
-->

### Configuration title (e.g. Striped rows)

<!--
  A brief description of what this configuration provides to users and when it
  should be used.
-->

<!--
  A live example of the component configuration, with access to the correspoding
  source code.

  In Storybook this is done using something like:

  <Canvas>
    <Story id="..." />
  </Canvas>
-->

## Content

<!--
  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  Add any component-specific content guidance here, use visual examples where
  appropriate.

  For example, a Button component might include guidance on recommended terms to
  use for the label text, recommended maximum character counts, etc.
-->

## Accessibility

<!--
  OPTIONAL: Remove this section if it is not applicable.

  Describe any considerations the users may need to take into account when using
  the component.
