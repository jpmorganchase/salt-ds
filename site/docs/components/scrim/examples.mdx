<LivePreview componentName="scrim" exampleName="Default">

### Default

By default, a scrim is bound to its parent container.

#### Best practices

Ensure you have explicitly set a position attribute for the parent container.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="scrim" exampleName="WithSpinner">

### With Spinner

You can pass children to a scrim, such as a spinner to indicate loading state. You can incorporate other elements as children, to display them above the scrim and draw attention to them.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="scrim" exampleName="CloseOnClick">

### Close on click

Pass an `onClick` handler to a scrim to close it on click. This is useful for modals or any floating elements where clicking on the scrim area (outside the main content) should dismiss the view.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="scrim" exampleName="Fixed">

### Fixed

A fixed scrim fills the entire viewport, regardless of the parent container.
