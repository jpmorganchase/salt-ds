### Using the component

- Keep the text description short, ideally one to three words and no more than five. If you’re including an icon with the text, use no more than three words.
- For icons, use the Salt Figma icon library. If the icon you need isn’t available, follow the steps in our [Creating Salt icons](<https://www.figma.com/file/ibGX0b0CxUcZU3pn6OrqX7/Salt%3A-Icons-(Community)?type=design&node-id=490-74&mode=design>) guide.

#### When to use

To allow the user to execute an action, such as “submit”, “merge” or “upload”. Buttons are typically placed in components and contexts such as [dialogs](../dialog), [cards](../card) and [forms](/salt/patterns/forms).

#### When not to use

When the primary action is to take the user to another page or window rather than to trigger a function. Instead, use [`Link`](../link).

### Import

{/* Update the text and code snippet below as needed: */}

To import `Button` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Button } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

{/* Update packageName and componentName below as needed */}
{/* packageName is optional and defaults to "core" if omitted */}

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Button" />

### Content

- Always style button text in all caps for prominence. This avoids confusion with body text or general writing.
- Never use ampersand (&) in button text to save space.
