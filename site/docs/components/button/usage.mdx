### Using the Button component

- Keep the text label short. Ideally one to three words and no more than five. If you’re including an icon in the label, use no more than three words.
- When including icons, use the Salt Figma icon library. If the icon you need isn’t available, follow the steps in our Creating Salt icons guide.

#### When to use Button

- Use buttons to communicate actions that a user can perform, such as “submit”, “merge”, “upload” etc. Buttons are typically placed in components/contexts such as [Dialog](http://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/dialog) and [Forms](http://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/formfield).

#### When not to use Button

- Consider a [Link](http://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/link) instead of the Button component if the user is navigating to a new page or window rather than carrying out an action. The exception to this behaviour is if the navigation is the core action on the page. In this case, a CTA button should be used to trigger the navigation.

### Import

{/* Update the text and code snippet below as needed: */}

To import Button from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Button } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

{/* Update packageName and componentName below as needed */}
{/* packageName is optional and defaults to "core" if omitted */}

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Button" />

### Content

- Always style button text in all caps for prominence and to avoid confusion with body text/general writing. This styling makes it clearer that buttons are interactive even when they don’t have an outline.
- Never use ampersand (&) in button text to save space.
