### Using the Button component

- Keep the text label short. Ideally one to three words and no more than five. If you’re including an icon in the label, use no more than three words.

- When including icons, use the Salt Figma icon library. If the icon you need isn’t available, follow the steps in our Creating Salt icons guide.

- Consider a Link instead of the Button component if the user is navigating to a new page or window rather than carrying out an action.

### Import

To import Button from the core Salt package, use:

```
import { Button } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

:propsTable{src="../../packages/core/src/button/Button.tsx"}
