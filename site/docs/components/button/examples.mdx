### CTA (call to action)

Use the CTA button for high priority actions.

#### Guidance

- Choose a CTA button when an action is more urgent than other visible buttons.
- Use it for important or irreversible actions, such as agreeing to terms and conditions or deleting a profile.
- Only display one CTA button per screen to emphasize the next action the user should take.
