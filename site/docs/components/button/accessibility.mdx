### Best practices

- When a Button has both an icon and text, use`aria-hidden` on the icon so that screen readers do not announce its text.
- When a Button has an icon only and no text, pass an `aria-label` to Button that describes its purpose.

#### Focusable disabled button

- By default, a disabled button is not focusable. However, in certain scenarios it may be preferable for a disabled button to receive focus. To determine if this is necessary, the following rule of thumb can be followed: "If a disabled element can be enabled (either by the user or by the system) it should be made focusable.‚Äù For further information, view the W3C guidance on the [`aria-disabled` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-disabled).

#### Screen reader behavior:

On focus, the screen reader should:

- Identify the button
- Read out the text,
- Express the state
  - In certain situations, the screen reader may need to indicate if the button has a popup for lists or menus.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab moves focus onto the button.
- If the button is disabled and not set to receive focus, Tab moves focus to the next focusable component.
- If the button has focus, Tab moves focus to the next focusable component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- Shift + Tab moves focus out of the component to the previous component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- If the button has focus, Enter or Space key press activates the button.
- If the button is disabled and can receive focus, does nothing.
