### Best practices

- When a button has both an icon and text, use `aria-hidden` on the icon so that screen readers don't announce its text.
- When a button has an icon only and no text, pass an `aria-label` to the button that describes its purpose.

#### Focusable disabled button

- By default, a user can't place focus on a disabled button. However in certain scenarios, it may be preferable for a disabled button to receive focus. To determine if this is necessary, you can apply the following rule of thumb: "If the user or the system can enable a disabled element, it should be focusable." For further information, view the W3C guidance on the [`aria-disabled` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-disabled).

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab moves focus to the button.
- If the button is disabled and cannot receive focus, Tab moves focus to the next focusable component.
- If the button has focus, Tab moves focus to the next focusable component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- This action moves focus out of the component to the previous component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- If the button has focus, this action activates it.
- If the button is disabled and can receive focus, this action does nothing.
