## Using the component

Skip links should be the first focusable element, placed in the screenâ€™s top-left corner. This allows keyboard and screen reader users to easily bypass headers and reach the main content. For more details, see the [App header anatomy](/salt/patterns/app-header#anatomy).

### When to use

Consider using skip links to:

- Bypass repetitive navigation or elements at the top of a page, providing direct access to the main content.
- Ensure screen reader and keyboard users can efficiently reach key sections of your web application.
- Prevent users from repeatedly hearing header and navigation content on every page before accessing the main content.

## Import

To import `SkipLink` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { SkipLink } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="SkipLink" />
