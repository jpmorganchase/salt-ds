### Radio Button Group (vertical)

Radio Button Groups allows users to select one or more values from a given set of choices. They can be aligned horizontally or vertically.

When `direction="vertical"`

Guidance:

- Keep text short and as concise as possible in the horizontal orientation.
- Do not truncate text descriptions as this can hide important content relevant to the user’s workflow. Consider shortening or rewording the label if space is limited.
- The radio button icon should always be placed left aligned to the text.
- We recommend that you always use a text description for a radio button.

### Radio Button Group (horizontal)

When `direction="horizontal"`

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Wrap" >

### Wrapping Radio Button group

The default behaviour for Radio Button Group in a horizontal alignment allows radio button options to wrap onto the next line as the viewport size changes if they don’t fit within a container.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="NoWrap" >

### Text wrapping

You can configure radio button groups to maintain a horizontal alignment but allow text wrapping by setting the prop `wrap=false`.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Disabled" >

### Disabled Radio Button

A disabled radio button is not interactive or focusable.

A radio button can be disabled by setting `disabled=”true”`.

Guidance:

Use a disabled state for radio buttons that have permissions, dependencies or pre-requisites. For example, a radio button in a [Form](/salt/patterns/forms) may be disabled because the user has not yet completed an earlier section of the form.

If a disabled radio button's text description contains information that is valuable to the user, consider using a read-only radio button instead.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Readonly" >

### Read-only Radio Button

A read-only radio button permits the user to only read or copy the value, but not edit the value or change the state of the radio.

A radio button with the prop `readOnly="true"` will suppress all functionality along with displaying read-only styling.

Guidance:

Read-only radio buttons are navigable using keyboard shortcuts. This means that, unlike disabled radio buttons, users can interact with the text description. Use a read-only radio button instead of a disabled radio button when the text description contains information that is valuable to the user.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Error">

### Validation states: error

You can indicate an error state stylistically by setting the `validationStatus` prop to "error".

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Warning">

### Validation states: warning

You can indicate a warning state stylistically by setting the `validationStatus` prop to "warning".

- When used in a group, use `validationStatus` on the group rather than the individual controls. Any status provided to the group will take precedence over the statuses applied directly to the nested controls.
- Avoid using `validationStatus` when a Radio Button is disabled. If provided, disabled functionality and styling will take precedence over any validation status styling.

### Long text support

Radio Button supports long text descriptions. If text wraps to multiple lines, align it to the top of the radio button.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="WithFormField" >

### Form Field compatibility

Radio Button group can be wrapped in a Form Field when it’s displayed within a Form context. This provides functionality built into Form Field for increased accessibility.

For more information, refer to the [Form Field](/salt/patterns/forms) guidance.
