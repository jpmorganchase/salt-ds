## Radio button group (vertical)

Radio button groups allow users to select one or more values from a given set of choices. You can align them horizontally or vertically.

When `direction="vertical"`

### Best practices

- Keep text short and as concise as possible in the horizontal orientation.
- Do not truncate text descriptions as this can hide important content relevant to the user’s workflow. Consider shortening or rewording the label if space is limited.
- The radio button icon should always be placed left aligned to the text.
- We recommend that you always use a text description for a radio button.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Default" />

## Radio button group (horizontal)

When `direction="horizontal"`

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Horizontal" />

## Wrapping radio button group

The default behaviour for Radio Button Group in a horizontal alignment allows radio button options to wrap onto the next line as the viewport size changes if they don’t fit within a container.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Wrap" />

## Text wrapping

You can configure radio button groups to maintain a horizontal alignment but allow text wrapping by setting the prop `wrap=false`.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="NoWrap" />

## Disabled radio button

A disabled radio button isn't interactive or focusable.

You can disable a radio button by setting `disabled={true}`.

### Best practices

Use a disabled state for radio buttons that have permissions, dependencies or pre-requisites. For example, a radio button in a [form](/salt/patterns/forms) may be disabled because the user hasn't yet completed an earlier section of the form.

If a disabled radio button's text description contains information that is valuable to the user, consider using a read-only radio button instead.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Read-only radio button

A read-only radio button permits the user to only read or copy the value, but not edit the value or change the state of the radio.

A radio button with the prop `readOnly={true}` will suppress all functionality along with displaying read-only styling.

**Note:** Screen reader support for read-only radio buttons is limited. You can work around this by adding visual or non-visual labels.

### Best practices

Users can interact with read-only radio buttons using keyboard shortcuts. This means that, unlike disabled radio buttons, users can interact with the text description. Use a read-only radio button instead of a disabled radio button when the text description contains information valuable to the user.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Readonly" />

## Validation states: error

You can indicate an error state stylistically by setting the `validationStatus` prop to `"error"`.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Error" />

## Validation states: warning

You can indicate a warning state stylistically by setting the `validationStatus` prop to `"warning"`.

- In a group, use `validationStatus` rather than the individual controls. Any status provided to the group will take precedence over the statuses applied directly to the nested controls.
- Avoid using `validationStatus` with a disabled radio button. If provided, disabled functionality and styling will take precedence over any validation status styling.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="Warning" />

## Long text support

Radio Button supports long text descriptions. If text wraps to multiple lines, align it to the top of the radio button.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="LongText" />

## Form field compatibility

You can wrap `RadioButtonGroup` in a form field when it’s within a form context.

For more information, refer to the [form field](/salt/patterns/forms) guidance.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="WithFormField" />

## Descriptions

You can add a description to a radio button using a `StackLayout` in the `label` prop.

<LivePreview componentName="radio-button" exampleName="WithDescription" />
