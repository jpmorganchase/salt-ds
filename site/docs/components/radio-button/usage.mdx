### Using the Radio Button component

- When you have fewer than five options and only single selection is required

#### When not to use Radio Button

- If you have a Boolean selection (on/off) consider using a [Switch](http://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/switch).
- When you have fewer than five options and multiple selection is required, in this case use a [Checkbox group](http://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/checkbox).
- When you have more than five and fewer than ten options, in this case use [Dropdown](http://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/dropdown).
