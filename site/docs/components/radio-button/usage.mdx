### Using the components

#### When to use

- When you have fewer than five options and only single selection is necessary.

#### When not to use

- When you have a Boolean selection (on/off). Instead, use [`Switch`](../switch).
- When you have fewer than five options and multiple selection is necessary. Instead, use [`CheckboxGroup`](../checkbox).
- When you have more than five and fewer than 10 options. Instead, use [`Dropdown`](../dropdown).
- When you have more than 10 options. Instead, use [`ComboBox`](../combo-box).
