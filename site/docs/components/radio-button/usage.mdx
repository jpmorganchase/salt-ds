### Using the `RadioButton` component

#### When to use `RadioButton`

- When you have fewer than five options and only single selection is necessary.

#### When not to use `RadioButton`

- When you have a Boolean selection (on/off). Instead, use [`Switch`](../switch).
- When you have fewer than five options and multiple selection is necessary. Instead, use [`CheckboxGroup`](../checkbox).
- When you have more than five and fewer than 10 options. Instead, use [`Dropdown`](../dropdown).
