title: Radio button
data:
  description: "`RadioButton` and `RadioButtonGroup` show a set of mutually exclusive options. Users can only select one radio button at a time. When selecting a new option, the previously selected option automatically clears. Radio buttons should be used to display a choice between two or more options, since users cannot clear a single radio button after selecting it."
