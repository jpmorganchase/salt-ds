title: Radio Button
data:
  description: Radio Button and Radio Button Group represent a set of mutually exclusive, but related options. Only one radio button can be selected at a time. When a user selects a new option, the previously selected option is automatically deselected. Radio Button should therefore be used to display a choice between two or more options, as it’s impossible to deselect a single radio button once it’s been selected.
