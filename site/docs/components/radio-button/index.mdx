title: Radio button
data:
  description: "`RadioButton` and `RadioButtonGroup` represent a set of mutually exclusive but related options. The user can only select one radio button at a time. When a user selects a new option, the previously selected option automatically clears. Therefore, radio buttons should therefore be used to display a choice between two or more options, as itâ€™s impossible to clear a single radio button after selecting it."
