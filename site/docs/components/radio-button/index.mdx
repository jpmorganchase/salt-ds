title: Radio Button
data:
  description: A group of Radio Button components represents a set of mutually exclusive, but related options. Only one radio button can be selected at a time. When a user selects a new option, the previously selected option is automatically deselected. Radio Buttons should therefore be used to display a choice between two or more options, as it’s impossible to deselect a single Radio Button once it’s been selected.
