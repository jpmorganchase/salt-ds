### Best practices

- On focus, the screen reader should:

  - Identify the radio button
  - Read out the text
  - Express the state

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Moves focus to the checked radio button in the radio button group.
- If a radio button is not checked, focus moves to the first radio button in the group.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- If the radio button with focus is not checked, changes the state to checked.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up/Down / Left/Right">

- Moves focus between the available radio button options, and simultaneously selects an option.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
