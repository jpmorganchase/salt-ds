## Best practices

- Avoid using infographics, maps, charts as images or [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-text-presentation.html).
- Order slides by importance, with the most critical info first.
- If composing with navigation controls (previous/next buttons or tablist), ensure they are the first elements to receive focus, enabling the user to control the carousel, on initial focus.

### Accessible name

- If the carousel has a visible label, its accessible label is provided by `aria-labelledby` on the carousel container set to the ID of the the visible label. Otherwise, an accessible label is provided using `aria-label` set on the carousel container.
  - Note that since the `aria-roledescription` is set to "carousel", the label does not contain the word "carousel".
- If a slide has a visible label, its accessible label is provided by `aria-labelledby` on the slide container set to the ID of the visible label. Otherwise, an accessible label is provided by using `aria-label` set on the slide container.
  - Note that since the `aria-roledescription` is set to "slide", the label does not contain the word "slide."

### With tablist

If composing with a tablist:

- Ensure the tablist is the first element to receive focus, enabling the user to control the carousel, on initial focus.
- Remove the next and prev buttons from the focus order, as the tablist provides sufficient navigation controls.
- If multiple slides are visible at one time, do not include a tablist, as a tablist should only be used with single slides.
- Ensure each slide has `role="tabpanel"` and `aria-roledescription="slide".

### Without tablist

If composing without a tablist:

- Ensure each slide within a carousel has `role="group"` and `aria-roledescription="slide"`.

### Autoplay

If using Autoplay, then additional considerations are required

- include accessible controls to start and stop the autoplay feature, allowing users to manage the animation according to their preferences.
- consider requiring user consent to enable autoplay, especially for users who may find automatic movement disorienting.
  - stop the autoplay if the user hovers over the carousel.
  - stop the autoplay if the user drags a slide.
  - stop the autoplay when content within a carousel slide receives focus, ensuring users can interact with the content without distraction.
- ensure screen readers do not announce changes in slide content during autoplay as the constant interruptions make the page unusable for a screen reader user.
- unset `aria-roledescription` to align with JPM accessibility recommendations.
- if autoplay of content starts upon init, the slides should pause upon hover.
- if the user has to press play to see more content, the slides do not need to pause upon hover.

### Multiple slides per tab

If using with multiple slides per tab, this will create increased complexity for the users relying on assistive technologies.

- consider whether a single slide view is sufficient for your use case, as it simplifies navigation and interaction.
  - unset `aria-roledescription` to align with JPM accessibility recommendations.
  - change the `aria-label` of the next and previous buttons to reflect the multiple slides. For example, "previous group of slides" rather than "previous slide" and "next group of slides" rather than "next slide" .

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is on the element immediately before the carousel, moves focus into the carousel, setting focus on the appropriate carousel navigation control (previous button or selected tab).
- If focus is on the previous button, moves focus to the next button.
- If focus is on a selected tab in the tablist, moves focus to the slide.
- If focus is on the slide, moves focus to the next focusable element within the current slide or the next appropriate focusable element on the page outside the carousel.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is on the next button, moves focus to the previous button, enabling backward navigation through controls.
- If focus is on a selected tab in the tablist, moves focus to the previous appropriate focusable element on the page outside the carousel.
- If focus is on a slide, moves focus to the previous slide (if available), otherwise the appropriate carousel navigation control (next button or selected tab), ensuring logical backward navigation order.
- If focus is on the element immediately after the carousel, sets focus on the last interactive element on the visible slide (if available), otherwise focus on the visible slide, allowing for backward navigation through the carousel.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter">

- If focus is on the next button, the next slide is displayed and keeps focus on the button, allowing for continuous navigation.
- If focus is on the previous button, the previous slide is displayed and keeps focus on the button, facilitating backward navigation.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Right arrow">

- If focus is on a selected tab in the tablist and there are more tabs to the right, moves the focus to the next tab.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left arrow">

- If focus is on a selected tab in the tablist and there are more tabs to the left, moves the focus to the previous tab.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Home">

- If focus is on a selected tab in the tablist and there are more tabs to the left, moves the focus to the first tab, allowing quick access to the beginning of the carousel

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="End">

- If focus is on a selected tab in the tablist and there are more tabs to the right, moves the focus to the last tab, allowing quick access to the end of the carousel.

</KeyboardControl>
