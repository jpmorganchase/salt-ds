## Default

Use the default setting to allow users to navigate the carousel in single slide increments, moving either backward or forward through the sequence.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Default" />

## Multiple slides

Use the multiple slides settings to allow users to navigate the carousel in single slide increments while displaying more than one slide at a time.

To display multiple slides, pass multiple values (one per breakpoint) or a single value of the number of slides to show in `visibleSlides`.
