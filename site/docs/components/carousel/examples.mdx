## Default

<Callout>
  Carousel is a pre-defined composition of Salt components that uses the
  [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) API.
</Callout>

You can customize both the content and navigation, according to your needs, see the [usage](./usage) documentation for guidance.

Alternatively, the `CarouselCard` component offers an option for creating slide elements.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Card" />

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">

Consider how the Carousel integrates within the page structure.

You can use a heading element like `H1` or `H2` as the Carousel’s title and associate it with the Carousel using the `aria-labelledby` attribute.

</GuidanceCallout>

## Bordered

Bordered slides enhance differentiation between individual slides. Enable `CarouselCard` borders by setting the `bordered` prop to true.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="BorderedCard" />

## Multiple slides

The carousel can showcase multiple slides simultaneously, offering flexibility in single or multiple slide increments.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  It is recommended to include a preview of the next slide in the sequence to
  enhance user anticipation. Allow a recommended, 4%, of space to enable the
  next slide in the sequence to be visible.
</GuidanceCallout>

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="MultipleSlides" />

## Autoplay

Autoplay can be added through the embla plugin [`Autoplay`](https://www.embla-carousel.com/plugins/autoplay/), but requires additional code to support accessibility.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  
- Continue cycling through the frames with 5–7s delays. 
- Add a progress indicator. 
- Pause the animation upon hover. 
- Stop the slideshow upon any user interaction with content and do not resume, unless the user restarts it with the play button.

</GuidanceCallout>

The example below demonstrates accessible autoplay for illustrative purposes.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Autoplay" />

## Controlled

The Embla API enables programmatic control, such as the visible slide.

  Refer to the [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) documentation for the
