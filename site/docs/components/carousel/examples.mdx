## Default

Carousel is a composition of Salt components that uses the [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) API.

The default carousel navigates through slides individually, one at a time.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Default" />

## Adding titles

Adding a title serves as a heading for the displayed content.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Title" />

## Controls placement

Controls can be located at the bottom of the carousel.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="BottomControls" />

## Pagination

Pagination controls can be integrated into the carousel, offering both a visual indicator of the current slide and clickable elements that allow users to navigate directly to specific slides.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Pagination" />

## Multiple slides

This carousel component can display multiple slides simultaneously.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="MultipleSlides" />

## Card

Carousel slides can contain your own content but `CarouselCard` provides a convenient slide component.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Card" />

## Bordered

Bordered cards add a visual distinction to each slide, enhancing the overall appearance and making it easier for users to differentiate between individual slides.

`CarouselCard` can include a border by setting the `bordered` prop to `true`.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="BorderedCard" />

## Additional actions

[`Link`](../link) can be incorporated into a carousel slide, but avoid embedding other clickable actions during animation to prevent accidental clicks while slides are transitioning.

`CarouselCard` also supports actions, through the `actions` prop.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="CardActions" />

## Accessing the embla API

When composed with other components the visible slide can be controlled programmatically using the `embla` API.

Refer to the [Embla documentation](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) for the full API.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="ControlledCarousel" />

## Autoplay

Autoplay can be added through the embla plugin [`Autoplay`](https://www.embla-carousel.com/plugins/autoplay/), but requires additional code to support accessibility.

The example below provides accessibility support but if you compose your own, then refer to the [APG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/).

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Autoplay" />

## Fade

Fade transitions can be added through the embla plugin [`Fade`](https://www.embla-carousel.com/plugins/fade/).

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Fade" />
