Carousel is a pre-defined pattern of Salt components that uses the [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) API.

You can customize the content within carousel slides according to your needs (see the [usage](./usage) documentation for guidance).
Alternatively, the `CarouselCard` component offers a straightforward option for creating slide elements.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Card" />

## Bordered

Bordered cards add a visual distinction to each slide, enhancing the overall appearance and making it easier for users to differentiate between individual slides.

`CarouselCard` can include a border by setting the `bordered` prop to `true`.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="BorderedCard" />

## Multiple slides

This carousel component can display multiple slides simultaneously.

Allow a recommended, 4%, of space to enable the next slide in the sequence to be visible.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="MultipleSlides" />

## Autoplay

Autoplay can be added through the embla plugin [`Autoplay`](https://www.embla-carousel.com/plugins/autoplay/), but requires additional code to support accessibility.

The example below provides accessibility support but if you compose your own, then refer to the [APG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/carousel/).

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Autoplay" />
