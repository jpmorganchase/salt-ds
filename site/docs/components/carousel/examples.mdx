## Default (single slide)

Carousel navigates through content in single slide increments, allowing movement either backward or forward through the sequence.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Default" />

## Multiple slides

This carousel component can display multiple slides simultaneously, with the `visibleSlides` prop.

Alternatively the `visibleSlides` prop is responsive, and can adapt the number of visible slides based on the breakpoint.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="MultipleSlides" />

## With title

The carousel title, passed as the `title` prop to `CarouselControls`, is optional and appears above the carousel to provide context or serve as a heading for the displayed content.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="WithTitle" />

## Bordered

Carousel slides can be bordered by setting the `bordered` prop to `true`. This adds a visual distinction to each slide, enhancing the overall appearance and making it easier for users to differentiate between individual slides.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Bordered" />

## With slide actions

[`Link`](../link) can be incorporated into a carousel slide, but avoid embedding other clickable actions during animation to prevent accidental clicks while slides are transitioning.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="WithSlideActions" />

## Controls placement

You can set the `controlsPlacement` property to either `top` or `bottom` to position the controls accordingly. This offers flexibility in design to suit different layout and user experience requirements.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="ControlsPlacement" />

## Controlled carousel

When composed with other components the visible slide can be controlled programmatically using the `activeIndex` prop.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="ControlledCarousel" />
