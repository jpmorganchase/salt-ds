## How to build

Carousel is a composable pattern of Salt components that uses the [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) API.

A basic carousel navigates through slides individually, one at a time.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Basic" />

<br />
Adding a title serves as a heading for the displayed content.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Title" />
<br />
`CarouselTabList` is an aria `tablist` providing support for screen readers to
announce the slides as the associated`tab`. To enhance accessibility, ensure
that each slide has a unique id. This will facilitate the association between
the `tablist` and `tab`, thereby improving screen reader functionality.

A `tablist` provides a visual indicator of the current slide and includes clickable elements for direct navigation to specific slides, along with keyboard navigation controls. Ensure the tablist is positioned at the top or bottom of the carousel, alongside other controls like `CarouselNextButton` and `CarouselPreviousButton`.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="TabList" />

<br />
Additional actions, such as[`Link`](../link), can be incorporated into a
carousel slide, but avoid embedding other clickable actions during animation to
prevent accidental clicks while slides are transitioning.

`CarouselCard` also supports actions, through the `actions` prop.

Content within slides can be tabbable but ensure that off-screen content is not tabbable, as this can lead to a poor user experience.
This example ensures that CSS is applied to the off-screen content, preventing it from being tabbable.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="CardActions" />

## Configuration and control of Embla

When composed with other components the visible slide can be controlled programmatically using the `embla` API.

Refer to the [Embla documentation](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) for the full API.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="ControlledCarousel" />

## Using the component

### When to use

- To enable more than one piece of content to occupy the same space.
- To navigate small amounts content, that are viewed in a linear sequence.
- To position information near the top of the viewable area.

### When not to use

- When content discovery and drawing attention is a priority for your product.
- To display less than 2 or more than 5 pieces of content.

### Best practices

- Always provide navigation controls for the carousel, alongside a visual indicator of the current slide.
- Include 5 or fewer slides. The most important slide always comes first.
- Not all content is visible within a carousel until selected, ensure that important content is also placed on another page of your site.
- To provide arrow key navigation add a tablist.
