## Navigation

Carousels offer two types of navigation, sequential and non-sequential.

### Sequential with slide group

When content is sequential, create a slide group, to ensure slides are read in a specific order.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">
  Do not include a tablist, as this would enable the content to be read out of
  sequence.
</GuidanceCallout>

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Basic" />
<br />

### Non-sequential with tablist

When you have content which can be accessed in any order, then `CarouselTabList` provides a visual indicator of the current slide and clickable elements for direct navigation to specific slides. Position the tablist, either at the top or bottom of the carousel, alongside other controls like `CarouselNextButton` and `CarouselPreviousButton`.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="TabListTop" />
<br />

If you position a `tablist` or navigation controls at the bottom of the carousel, the slides will initially receive focus. To provide an accessibility user experience, navigation controls should receive focus before the content. You can achieve this by using an additional `div` to reverse the flex direction, thereby ensuring the navigation controls are focused first.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="TabListBottom" />
<br />

## Content

`CarouselCard` is a ready-made Card component that can be used within a `Carousel`.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Card" />

### With focusable slide content

Incorporate actions, such as a `Link`, into a slide. `CarouselCard` supports actions, through the `actions` prop.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">

- Actions such as[`Link`](../link), can be incorporated into a carousel slide, but avoid embedding other clickable actions during animation to prevent accidental clicks while slides are transitioning.
- Content within slides can be tabbable but ensure that off-screen content is not tabbable and hidden from the screen-reader, as this can lead to a poor user experience.

</GuidanceCallout>

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="CardActions" />
<br />

## Using the component

### When to use

- To enable more than one piece of content to occupy the same space.
- To navigate small amounts content, that are viewed in a linear sequence.
- To position information near the top of the viewable area.

### When not to use

- When content discovery and drawing attention is a priority for your product.
- To display less than 2 or more than 5 pieces of content.

<GuidanceCallout type="positive" customPillText="Best practices">

- Always provide navigation controls for the carousel, alongside a visual indicator of the current slide.
- When tabbing through the focus order, ensure that any tablist or navigation controls receive focus before the slide.
- Include 5 or fewer slides. The most important slide always comes first.
- Not all content is visible within a carousel until selected, ensure that important content is also placed on another page of your site.
- To access content, un-ordered content, out of sequence, add a tablist.
- Do not use a tablist when more than one slide is visible.
