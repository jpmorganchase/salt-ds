## How to build

Carousel is a composable pattern of Salt components that uses the [Embla](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) API.

A basic carousel navigates through slides individually, one at a time.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Basic" />

<br />
Adding a title serves as a heading for the displayed content.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Title" />

<br />A Progress indicator, `CarouselProgress`, can be integrated into the
carousel, offering both a visual indicator of the current slide and clickable
elements that allow users to navigate directly to specific slides. Always ensure
that the progress indicator is co-located top or bottom of the carousel,
alongside any other controls, such as
`CarouselNextButton','CarouselPreviousButton` and `CarouselPagination`.'

Pagination includes support for screen readers. To enhance accessibility, ensure that each slide has a unique id. This will facilitate the association between the `tablist` and `tab`, thereby improving screen reader functionality.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="Pagination" />

<br />
Additional actions, such as[`Link`](../link), can be incorporated into a
carousel slide, but avoid embedding other clickable actions during animation to
prevent accidental clicks while slides are transitioning.

`CarouselCard` also supports actions, through the `actions` prop.

Content in slides can be tabbable but ensure that off-screen content is not tabbable, as this can lead to a poor user experience.
This example ensures that CSS (`visibility: hidden`) is applied to the off-screen content, preventing it from being tabbable.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="CardActions" />

## Configuration and control of Embla

When composed with other components the visible slide can be controlled programmatically using the `embla` API.

Refer to the [Embla documentation](https://www.embla-carousel.com/) for the full API.

<LivePreview componentName="carousel" exampleName="ControlledCarousel" />

## Using the component

### When to use

- To enable more than one piece of content to occupy the same space.
- To navigate small amounts content, that are viewed in a linear sequence.
- To position information near the top of the viewable area.

### When not to use

- When content discovery and drawing attention is a priority for your product.
- To display less than 2 or more than 5 pieces of content.

### Best practices

- Include 5 or fewer slides. The most important slide always comes first.
- Indicate where the user is within the progression.
- Ensure that important content is also placed on another page of your site.
