## Using the component

The component is typically used in a form. It’s ideal for fields that can contain multiple, specific values related to a single topic or context—and these values can be removed quickly and in their entirety. You would use the component, for example, in a field for email addresses or a fast field for a cash ticket.

### When not to use

- To generate a list of suggested values that partially match the text entered by the user. Instead, use [`ComboBoxNext`](/salt/components/combo-box/).
- To choose exclusively from options in an existing dataset. Instead, use [`ComboBoxNext`](/salt/components/combo-box/).

## Import

To import `TokenizedInputNext` from the lab Salt package, use:

```js
import { TokenizedInputNext } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```

## Props

<PropsTable packageName="lab" componentName="TokenizedInputNext" />
