## Using the component

### When to use

Use a multiline input when asking a user a subjective question and the length of their answer is unknown. The input can give them plenty of space to answer the question and review the answer. If you can take an educated guess at the possible length of their answer, set the height accordinglyâ€”see the "Number of rows" example.

### When not to use

Multiline input field width and height should always reflect the amount of content expected in the field. If the content is unlikely to exceed a single line, always use [`Input`](../input).

## Import

To import `MultilineInput` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { MultilineInput } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props

<PropsTable componentName="MultilineInput" />
