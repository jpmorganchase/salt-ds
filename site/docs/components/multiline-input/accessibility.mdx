### Best practices

- Wrap `MultilineInput` in [`FormField`](/salt/components/form-field) to provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. This will ensure it complies with accessibility guidelines. You can find more information [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

- A multiline input will clip text that extends beyond its visible area. This behavior is common to all states, i.e., default, read-only and disabledâ€”whether or not the input has focus. To view the text in its entirety, the user can traverse the characters using the cursor.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is above the multiline input, Tab moves focus onto the multiline input and highlights the text. If the multiline input area is empty, it will display the text cursor.
- If the multiline input is disabled, Tab skips the multiline input.
- If the multiline input has focus, Tab moves focus out of the multiline input to next focusable component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focused, this action moves focus out of the component to the previous component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter">

- If an interactive adornment, e.g., a button, has focus, Enter actions the element.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- When the multiline input area has focus, Space inserts a space character at the positon of the text cursor.
- If an interactive adornment, e.g., a button, has focus, actions the element.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Right arrow">

When the multiline input area has focus:

- If text is in a highlighted state, Right arrow removes the highlight and positions the text cursor at the right edge of the highlight.
- If the text cursor is visible, Right arrow positions it on the alternative side of the following character. If there's no following character, there's no effect.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left arrow">

When the multiline input area has focus:

- If text is in a highlighted state, Left arrow removes the highlight and positions the text cursor at the left edge of the highlight.
- If the text cursor is visible, Left arrow positions it on the alternative side of the following character. If there's no preceding character, there's no effect.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Left arrow / Shift + Right arrow">

This action drags selection over text characters, one at a time.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Backspace">

When the multiline input area has focus and:

- Text is highlighted, Backspace removes all highlighted characters.
- The text cursor is to the right of text, Backspace removes the preceding character.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Alphanumeric/Special keys">

When the multiline input area has focus, this action inserts the relevant character at the point where the text cursor is positioned.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Control + A / Command + A">

This action highlights all strings within the field.

</KeyboardControl>
