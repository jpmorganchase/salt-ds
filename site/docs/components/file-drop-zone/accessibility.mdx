### Best practices

- Consider using the File Drop Zone within forms when it's necessary for users to attach supporting files.
- Make sure any limits, such as maximum file size and type restrictions, are communicated to users prior to upload. If an upload failure results, ensure that the reason for the error-and how to resolve it-are clearly explained.
- Inform users when files successfully upload to reassure them that the action has been completed.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab sets focus to the **Browse files** button. If focus is in the file drop zone, Tab sets focus to the next focusable component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is in the file drop zone, this action sets focus to the previous focusable component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space / Enter">

- When focus is on the **Browse files** button, this action activates the button and opens the native file explorer window.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
  Note: The operating system determines keyboard interactions within the file explorer.
