  <LivePreview componentName="file-drop-zone" exampleName="Default">

    ### Default

    This component allows users to upload files they've selected from the native file browser interface or dragged-and-dropped. The component automatically uploads the files to your web application.
    You can customize the message in the file drop zone to suit your needs.

    Note that the banner is not part of the component, and is in the example as an illustration only.

    Information about files you upload to this example will be stored on our UI Toolkit servers.
