    ### FileDropZone

    This component allows users to upload files they've selected from the native file browser interface or dragged-and-dropped — with the files automatically uploaded to your web application.
    The message in the File drop zone can be customized to suit your needs.

    Note that the banner is not part of the component, and is in the example as an illustration only.
    Information about files you upload to this example will be stored on our UI Toolkit servers.
