### Using the component

#### Composition

When composing the file drop zone, consider using `FileDropZoneIcon` to help inform users by showing an upload icon while items have not been updated and a status icon giving feedback about the state of the input.
It is recommended to pass a title paragraph to the component to indicate the expected action.
You can customize the `FileDropZoneTrigger`'s text by passing `children` into the component.
If specific criteria is required, make sure you communicate any limits, such as maximum file size and type restrictions as validation text, before the user uploads their file. If the upload fails, clearly explain the reason why and how to resolve it.

#### Validation and acceptance criteria

Acceptable file types can be specified with the `accept` prop to `FileDropZoneTrigger`.
The `accept` prop doesn't validate the types of the selected files;
it provides hints for browsers to guide users towards selecting the correct file types,
You should make sure that the acceptance criteria is backed up by appropriate validation handled on `FileDropZone`'s `onDrop`.

Inform users when files successfully upload to reassure them that the action has completed.
To inform users of the criteria, you can display custom validation text on the File Drop Zone.
If uploaded files fail to meet your validation criteria, the File Drop Zone will display an error state.

#### When to use

- To enable users to upload single or multiple files from a native file browser.
- To enable users to attach supporting files to a form.

#### When not to use

- To display upload progress, file listing and management. This is a simple component that only provides an upload zone. Instead, use [`Dialog`](../dialog) as a starting point to create a more comprehensive file interface.
