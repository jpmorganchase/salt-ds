### Using the FileDropZone component

Use FileDropZone when you want to enable users to upload single or multiple files from a native file browser.

This simple component only provides the upload zone. If you'd like to display a Dialog — with advanced functionality such as upload progress, file listing and management — it will need to be created separately for your application.

### Import

To import FileDropZone from the lab Salt package, use:

```js
import { FileDropZone, FileDropZoneIcon, FileDropZoneTrigger } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```

### Props

#### File Drop Zone

<PropsTable packageName="lab" componentName="FileDropZone" />

#### File Drop Zone Icon
<PropsTable packageName="lab" componentName="FileDropZoneIcon" />

#### File Drop Zone Trigger
<PropsTable packageName="lab" componentName="FileDropZoneTrigger" />
