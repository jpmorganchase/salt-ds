## Using the component

### When to use

- To display keyboard shortcuts: Use Kbd to visually highlight keyboard keys or combinations (e.g., Ctrl + S) in documentation.
- Inline with instructions: When providing step-by-step instructions or help text that references keyboard actions.
- In buttons or inputs: To show associated shortcuts for actions, such as “Save (Ctrl + S)” in a button or “Press Enter” in an input field.
- To improve accessibility: When you want users to easily identify and understand available keyboard shortcuts.

### When not to use

- For non-keyboard actions: Do not use Kbd to represent mouse actions, gestures, or other non-keyboard interactions.
- For decorative purposes: Avoid using Kbd purely for styling or emphasis unrelated to keyboard input.
- For long text or sentences: Kbd is not suitable for wrapping entire sentences or paragraphs—use it only for individual keys or short key combinations.
- When the shortcut is not relevant: If there is no keyboard shortcut or key involved, use other components or plain text.
