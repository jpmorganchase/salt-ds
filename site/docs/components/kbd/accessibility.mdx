Screen readers will announce Kbd content as plain text.

## Best practices

- Always use Kbd alongside descriptive text that explains the associated action. For example: "Press Ctrl+K to open search" This ensures users understand the purpose of the keyboard shortcut.
- For multi-key shortcuts, include clear text separators (such as “+”) between keys (e.g, "Ctrl + Shift + K"). Avoid combining keys without separators (e.g., "CtrlShiftK")

### Focus Management

- The Kbd component itself is not focusable. When Kbd is nested within interactive elements (such as buttons or inputs), the parent element is responsible for handling all keyboard interactions.
