### Using the Input component

An Input is recommended when a user is asked a subjective question and the length of their answer is likely to be less than a single line. To avoid misleading users, set the width to correlates to the length of the answer youâ€™re expecting. For example, an input for a three-digit value should not be wide enough to accommodate a sentence worth of characters.

#### When not to use Input

Input field width and height should always reflect the amount of content expected in the field. If the content is likely to exceed a single line, always use a [Multiline Input](/salt/components/multiline-input), rather than an Input.

### Import

To import Input from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Input } from "@salt-ds/core";
```
