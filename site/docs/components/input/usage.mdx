### When to use Input

- To ask a user a subjective question to which user responses will vary and the length of their answer is likely to be less than a single line.
- To avoid misleading users, set the width to correlates to the length of the answer youâ€™re expecting. For example, an input for a three-digit value should not be wide enough to accommodate a sentence worth of characters. See [Forms pattern](/salt/patterns/forms) for more information on layout.

#### When not to use Input

When the content is likely to exceed a single line. Instead, use a [Multiline Input](/salt/components/multiline-input). Input field width and height should always reflect the amount of content expected in the field.

### Import

To import Input from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Input } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

<PropsTable componentName="Input" />
