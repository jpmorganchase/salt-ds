### Primary

Input comprises value text and a focus ring. The component is initially empty and then, once it has focus, it accepts text on a single line only.

The default variant for Input is "primary".

- Input is responsive to the size of its parent container, filling it 100%. To disable responsiveness, apply a fixed width and height using the CSS API.

### Secondary

Input has a "secondary" variant.

For recommendations on variant choice, see the [Forms pattern](salt/patterns/forms).

<LivePreview componentName="input" exampleName="Readonly" >

### Readonly

You can set Input to a read-only state. The value text can’t be edited in this state, but it can be highlighted and copied.

By default, the marker is set to an em dash. If your application requires a different marker it can be set via the emptyReadOnlyMarker prop.

- Use the read-only state when the value is necessary for the users flow or current task but cannot be edited, for example, because of user permissions.

### Placeholder

You can use a placeholder to prompt user input if no default value is provided.

- Placeholder Text should never be used to provide the user with contextual help since it will be removed when the user starts typing and does not meet minimum contrast requirements. Doing so is a WCAG failure. Instead, use Helper Text beneath the field to provide instructions or directions which are necessary to complete the field, and reserve the Placeholder Text to support the help message, or provide an example of the suggested content.

<LivePreview componentName="input" exampleName="StaticAdornments" >

### Static Adornments

You can add custom adornments at the beginning or end of the Input field using the `startAdornment` and `endAdornment` props. 

Start adornments are typically used to describe the purpose of the field (eg., a phone number input, or a currency), whereas end adornments are typically used to indicate a reveal of more information (eg., using an arrow icon) or to trigger a new UI (such as a date picker). 

Salt [Text](/salt/components/text) and [Icons](/salt/foundations/iconography) can be used to add Salt styled alphanumeric text or symbols as adornments. Multiple start or end adornments should be wrapped in a parent container and passed to the respective prop as a single fragment. Adornments can be dynamic, with their value depending on the current state.

### Button Adornments

You can use a [Button](/salt/components/button) the beginning or end of the Input field using the `startAdornment` and `endAdornment` props. Buttons can allow for custom interactivity within the Input field itself, or elsewhere in the app via the Input field.

Ensure to make your interactive Buttons disabled or readonly should it match the state of the containing Input field.

### Validation

Input can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

- Use the error state to alert the user of a critical issue that’s related to the input. This issue, which may jeopardize completion of the task, usually requires action from the user to resolve the error.

- Display the warning state when you need to alert the user of a potential issue—that won’t prevent the user from continuing with the task, but may cause errors if it’s not addressed.

### Text Alignment

Text is left-aligned by default. Use the `textAlign` prop to change the alignment to “center” or “right”.

- Numeric values are often displayed right aligned to make them easier to compare. However, sometimes number fields are unrelated or are mixed with text fields in a form, so left-alignment may promote better visual flow. Consider your use case when deciding on Input field alignment.

You may choose to center-align an input field to bring emphasis to a value, however, this should be the exception and used sparingly.
