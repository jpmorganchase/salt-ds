### Best practises

- To be considered accessible within a form, the Input must be wrapped in a [Form Field](/salt/components/form-field), which will provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. 

- Text that extends beyond the visible area of the Input is clipped. This behavior is common to all states, i.e., default, read-only and disabledâ€”whether or not the Input has focus. To view the text in its entirety, the user can traverse the characters using the cursor. 

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is above the Input, Tab key press moves focus onto the Input. The text will be highlighted. If the Input area is empty, the text cursor is displayed.
- If the Input is disabled, tabbing will skip the Input.
- If the Input has focus, Tab moves focus out of the Input, to next focusable component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab + Shift">

- If focused, Tab+Shift combo moves focus out of the component to the previous component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter">

- If an interactive adornment, e.g., a button, has focus, the element is actioned. 

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- When the Input area has focus, a space character is inserted at the point where the text cursor is positioned. 
- If an interactive adornment, e.g., a button, has focus, the element is actioned. 

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Right Arrow">

When the Input area has focus: 
- If text is highlighted, the highlight is removed and the text cursor is positioned at the right edge of the highlight. 
- If the text cursor is displayed, it is positioned on the alternative side of the following character. If is there is no following character, there is no effect. 

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left Arrow">

When the Input area has focus: 
- If text is highlighted, the highlight is removed and the text cursor is positioned at the left edge of the highlight. 
- If the text cursor is displayed, it is positioned on the alternative side of the following character. If is there is no preceding character, there is no effect. 

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Left/Right Arrow">
 
Drags selection over text characters, one at a time. 

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Backspace">
 
When Input area has focus and: 
- Text is highlighted, all highlighted characters are removed. 
- The text cursor is positioned to the right of text, the preceding character is removed. 

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Alphanumeric/Special keys">
 
When the Input area has focus, the relevant character is inserted at the point where the text cursor is positioned. 

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Control/Command + A">
