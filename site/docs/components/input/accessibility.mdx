### Best practices

- Wrap `Input` in [`FormField`](/salt/components/form-field) to provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. This will ensure it complies with accessibility guidelines. You can find more information [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

- The component clips text that extends beyond its visible area. All states have the same behavior—default, read-only and disabled—whether or not the input has focus. To view the text in its entirety, the user can traverse the characters using the cursor.

#### Empty read-only marker

For accessibility purposes, we recommend you use the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop to add a marker for empty read-only fields. This ensures it’s clear that a value is not necessary for the current selection or configuration.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is above the input, Tab moves focus onto the input and highlights the text. If the input area is empty, Tab displays a text cursor in the input area.
- If the input is disabled, Tab skips the input.
- If the input has focus, Tab moves focus out of the input, to next focusable component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

If focused, Shift + Tab moves focus out of the component to the previous component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter">

If an interactive adornment, e.g., a button, has focus, Tab activates the element.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- When the input area has focus, Space inserts a character at the position of the text cursor.
- If an interactive adornment, e.g., a button, has focus, Space activates the element.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Right Arrow">

When the input area has focus:

- If text is highlighted, the highlight is removed and the text cursor is positioned at the right edge of the highlight.
- If the text cursor is displayed, it is positioned on the alternative side of the following character. If is there is no following character, there is no effect.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left Arrow">

When the input area has focus:

- If text is in a highlighted state, Left Arrow removes the highlight and positions the text cursor at the left edge of the highlight.
- If the text cursor is visible, Left Arrow positions it on the alternative side of the following character. If there's no preceding character, there's no effect.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Left Arrow / Shift + Right Arrow">
 
Drags selection over text characters, one at a time.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Backspace">
 
When the input area has focus and: 
- Text is highlighted, this action removes all highlighted characters. 
- The text cursor is positioned to the right of text, this action removes the preceding character.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Alphanumeric/Special keys">
 
When the input area has focus, this action inserts the relevant character at the position of the text cursor.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Control + A / Command + A">
 
This action highlights all strings within the field.
