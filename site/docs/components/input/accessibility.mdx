- Wrap Input in a [Form Field](/salt/components/form-field) to make it accessible within a form. This will provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. More information can be found [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

- Text that extends beyond the visible area of Input is clipped. This behavior is common to all states, i.e., default, read-only and disabled—whether or not the input has focus. To view the text in its entirety, the user can traverse the characters using the cursor.

### Empty Read-only Marker

For accessibility purposes, we recommend you use the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop to add a marker for empty read-only fields. This ensures it’s clear that for the current selection or configuration a value is not necessary.
