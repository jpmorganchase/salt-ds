### Using the Progress component

It should be used when the operation will take more than a second to complete, to reassure users that the operation is in progress.

#### When not to use Progress

Do not use when an operation takes a short amount of time, as it may be confusing and distracting for users.

### Import

{/* Update the text and code snippet below as needed: */}

To import the Progress components from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { CircularProgress } from "@salt-ds/core";
// or
import { LinearProgress } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

{/* Update packageName and componentName below as needed */}
{/* packageName is optional and defaults to "core" if omitted */}

#### Circular Progress

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="CircularProgress" />

#### Linear Progress

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="LinearProgress" />
