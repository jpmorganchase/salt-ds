### Using the Progress components

#### When to use Progress

- When itâ€™s possible to determine the length of time remaining for a task or operation to complete. This will reassure the user that it is being processed.
- To provide users with a visual indication of the status of an operation, or how much of a process is completed.

#### When not to use Progress

- When a task or operation will take an indeterminate length of time to complete. Instead, use [`Spinner`](/salt/components/spinner).
- To indicate the loading of content on navigation. Instead, use [`Spinner`](/salt/components/spinner).
