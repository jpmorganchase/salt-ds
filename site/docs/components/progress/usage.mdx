### Using the Component Name component

It should be used when the operation will take more than a second to complete, to reassure users that the operation is in progress.

#### When not to use Component Name

Do not use when an operation takes a short amount of time, as it may be confusing and distracting for users.

```
import { CircularProgress } from "@salt-ds/lab";
// or
import { LinearProgress } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```
