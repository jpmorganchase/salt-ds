## Accessible Name

* Recommended: Use a clear, descriptive label.

  * **Accessible Name Required** if more than one navigation landmark is present on the page.
* Avoid adding the word “navigation” to the accessible name. Assistive technologies will announce it automatically due to its role.

## Best Practices

* Display only links that all users can access.
* Limit expandable sections to two levels.

## Additional Consideration

* Provide a skip link to bypass the vertical navigation.

  * **Required** if the navigation appears across multiple pages **and** there is no “Skip to main” link as the first item on the page, to meet WCAG 2.4.1 requirement for bypassing repeated content.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">
    
    - Tab moves focus into the first navigation item in the vertical group. Sets focus to the entire component.
    - If a navigation item is selected before the navigation item receives focus, Tab sets focus on the selected item.
    - When the navigation item has children, second key press moves focus on to the arrow icon.
    - When the navigation item has focus, Tab moves focus out of the navigation item to the next component in tab order.
    
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">
    
    - If focus is below the navigation item, this action moves focus to the currently selected navigation item in the navigation item component.
    - If focus is on an item inside the navigation group, this action moves focus out of the navigation to the previous focusable element in the tab order.
    
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">
    
    - This action selects the focused navigation item.
