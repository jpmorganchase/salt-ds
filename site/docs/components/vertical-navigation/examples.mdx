## Basic

`VerticalNavigation` allows users to navigate between distinct applications and website pages. It supports two appearances: `indicator` and `bordered`.

<LivePreview componentName="vertical-navigation" exampleName="Basic" />

## Submenus

Nest navigation items under a parent navigation item to create a multilevel structure.

### Best practices

- Use `Divider` to visually separate nested items.

<LivePreview componentName="vertical-navigation" exampleName="Submenu" />

## Collapsible submenus

Compose `VerticalNavigation` with `Collapsible` to create a collapsible menu structure.

### Best practices

- When a collapsed submenu contains an active navigation item, the parent item should be set to active. This allows users to see where they are in the navigation hierarchy even when the submenu is collapsed.

<LivePreview
  componentName="vertical-navigation"
  exampleName="CollapsibleSubmenu"
/>

## Separate expand button

You can add a separate action button to a `VerticalNavigationItem` to allow one item to have a separate expand and navigation action.

<LivePreview
  componentName="vertical-navigation"
  exampleName="MultiActionItem"
/>

## With icons

Use an icon to effectively signify the navigation item’s purpose, whether it’s related to a product’s identity, a specific tool, function, or a configuration setting.

### Best practices

Ensure that you use icon descriptors consistently across all items within the same hierarchy level. This helps keep them equally weighted.

<LivePreview componentName="vertical-navigation" exampleName="WithIcons" />

## With badges

You can add a [badge](../badge) to a navigation item to serve as a visual cue. A badge can inform users of additional context, notifications, signpost new content or indicate a status.

### Best practices

Only place a badge in a navigation item that does not include nested items, i.e., it will not have a chevron.

<LivePreview componentName="vertical-navigation" exampleName="WithBadges" />
