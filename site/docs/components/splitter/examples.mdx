## Horizontal

The `Splitter` component accepts an orientation prop.

Set the `orientation` prop to `horizontal` to position handles horizontally.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="Horizontal" />

## Vertical

Set the `orientation` prop to `vertical` to position handles vertically.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="Vertical" />

## Multi-orientational

You can nest another `Splitter` component within a `SplitPanel` to achieve a multi-orientational layout. This allows you to create more complex and flexible designs by combining horizontal and vertical splits within the same interface.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="MultiOrientational" />

## Transparent

The transparent `Splitter` variant allows the background color of the parent container to show through by making the handles see-through.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="Transparent" />

## Border

Use the `border` prop to configure which sides of the `SplitHandle` component will have a border. This prop accepts one of seven options: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-bottom`, `left-right`, or `none`.

The default value for the `border` prop is dynamically computed based on the `orientation` and `appearance` of the parent `Splitter` component. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- If the parent `Splitter` has a `vertical` orientation and a `bordered` appearance, the default value for `border` will be `left-right`.
- If the parent `Splitter` has a `horizontal` orientation and a `bordered` appearance, the default value for `border` will be `top-bottom`.
- If the parent `Splitter` has a `transparent` appearance, the default value for `border` will be `none`.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="Border" />

## Variant

Use the `variant` prop to configure the background of the `SplitHandle` and `SplitPanel`. This prop accepts: `primary`, `secondary`, or `tertiary` background options.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="Variant" />

## Size

The combination of minSize, maxSize and defaultSize props provides fine-grained control over the splitter layout. By setting size boundaries, you can ensure visual balance and an optimal user experience.

By default every `SplitPanel` has a `minSize` of `10`. This is to ensure that 2 `SplitHandles` can't be placed directly next to each other.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="Size" />

## Collapsible

The `SplitPanel` components can be made collapsible by setting the `collapsible` and `collapsedSize` props. You can define a set size for the collapsed state using the `collapsedSize` prop. This allows you to maintain a specific size for the panel when collapsed, optimizing usability and accessibility.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="Collapsible" />

## Collapsible To 0

When the panel is allowed to be collapsed at 0, we advice to have a secondary way of expanding it. This can be in the form of an additional button on the page, and/or adding a double click event to the handle.

<LivePreview componentName="splitter" exampleName="CollapsibleTo0" />

## Programmable Resize

Collapsing, expanding or resizing a `SplitPanel` can be controlled externally using the imperative ref API.
