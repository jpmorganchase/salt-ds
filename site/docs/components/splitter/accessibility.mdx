## Best Practices

- Set an Appropriate `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for `SplitHandle`:  
   Make sure to assign a meaningful and descriptive `aria-label` to the `SplitHandle`. This will help screen readers and other assistive technologies accurately convey the purpose of the handle to users.

## Keyboard interactions

Keyboard interactions apply only to the `SplitHandle`s, which will be a child of the `Splitter` component.
