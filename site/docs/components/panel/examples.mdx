## Primary (default)

When using panels together, use the primary variant as the background for the most important content that you want the user to focus on first.

<LivePreview componentName="panel" exampleName="Primary" />

## Secondary

Use the secondary variant as the background to color block less important content.

<LivePreview componentName="panel" exampleName="Secondary" />

## Tertiary

Use the tertiary variant as an alternative background to the secondary variant or as an additional option to color block in a layout.

<LivePreview componentName="panel" exampleName="Tertiary" />
