## Using the component

### When to use

- For displaying categories in a catalogue or within a group.
- To display non-interactive data on a page.

### When not to use

- For quick filtering and selection, use [`Pill`](/salt/components/pill). Tags and Pills both categorize content in an app, but while Tags are read-only and simply display metadata, Pills are interactive and allow users to filter or sort content.
- To display counts, notifications or if you need a small, compact piece of information to be displayed inline, for example ‘New’. Instead, use [`Badge`](/salt/components/badge).

## Content

- Position each tag close to the element it refers to, creating a clear visual connection for all users.
  - Though typically placed after or below associated elements, tags may alternatively be placed elsewhere after carefully considering your specific layout requirements.
- Keep tag content brief and meaningful, limiting to one or two words.
- Use sentence case for tag labels.

## Import

To import `Tag` from the core Salt package, use:

```
import { Tag } from “@salt-ds/core”;
```

## Props

<PropsTable componentName="Tag" packageName="core" />
