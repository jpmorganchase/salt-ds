## Using the component

### When to use

- Use for categorizing, labeling, or read-only situations
- Use as a method of filtering data on a page, within a component, or in conjunction with search capabilities
- Use as a method to browse through a diverse range of products in different categories in order to quickly locate and access the specific product you require

### When not to use

For interactive elements that require user actions, such as filtering or selecting categories. Instead, use [`Pill`](/salt/components/pill).
To display counts, or notifications or if you need a small, compact piece of information to be displayed inline with text or icons. Instead, use [`Badge`](/salt/components/badge).

## Import

To import `Tag` from the core Salt package, use:

```
import { Tag } from “@salt-ds/lab”;
```

## Props

<PropsTable componentName="Tag" packageName="core" />
