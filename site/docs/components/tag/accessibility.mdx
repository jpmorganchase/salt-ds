## Best practices
- Position tags close to the elements they describe, maintaining visual connection to ensure clear contextual relationships for all users. 
  - While typically placed after or below associated elements, alternative placements may be appropriate based on your specific layout requirements.
- Use sentence case for tag labels.
- Keep tag content brief and meaningful, preferably limiting to one or two words.

## WCAG considerations

### [WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html)
When implementing tags to categorize content, ensure that color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. Text labels and/or icons should be the primary indicators for differentiating between tag categories, with color serving as a secondary, complementary indicator. 
  - This approach ensures that users who cannot perceive color differences (such as those with color blindness) can still understand the categorization system.
