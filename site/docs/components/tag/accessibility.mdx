## WCAG considerations

When implementing tags to categorize content, ensure color isn't used as the only visual means of conveying information [WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html). Text labels and/or icons should be the primary indicators for differentiating between tag categories, with color serving as a secondary, complementary indicator. 

This approach ensures users who cannot perceive color differences (such as those with color blindness) can still understand the categorization system.
