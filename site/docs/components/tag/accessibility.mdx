## Best practices
- Position each tag close to the element it refers to, creating a clear visual connection for all users.
  - Consider placement carefully - while typically placed after or below associated elements, alternative placements may be appropriate based on your specific layout requirements.
- Use sentence case for tag labels.
- Keep tag content brief and meaningful, limiting to one or two words.

## WCAG considerations

### [WCAG 1.4.1 Use of Color](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html)
When implementing tags to categorize content, ensure color isn't used as the only visual means of conveying information. Text labels and/or icons should be the primary indicators for differentiating between tag categories, with color serving as a secondary, complementary indicator. 
  - This approach ensures users who cannot perceive color differences (such as those with color blindness) can still understand the categorization system.
