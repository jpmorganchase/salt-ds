## Variants

Tag has two variants: primary and secondary. The primary variant is set by default. Set to secondary with `variant=”secondary”`.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="Bordered">

## Bordered

To add a border to tag, simply pass the `bordered` prop to the component.

Secondary tags have the ability to theme the border, although the border is not visible by default in the Salt theme.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="WithIcon">

## With icon

Use an icon inside a tag to visually reinforce its content for quick recognition. Icons should be displayed before the label.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="Categories">

## Categories

To differentiate between different categories, set a category by passing a value from 1 to 20 to the `category` prop.

Note that if a category outside the range is passed, the styles will default to category 1.

### Best practices

- Be consistent when assigning categories. For example, avoid assigning two different categories to the same piece of metadata.

## Tag in card

When using more than one tag next to each other, for example in a Card, apply `--salt-spacing-50` between them.
