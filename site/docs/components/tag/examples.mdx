## Variants

Tag has two variants: primary and secondary. The primary variant is set by default. Set to secondary with `variant=”secondary”`.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="Variants" />

## Bordered

To add a border to tag, simply pass the `bordered` prop to the component.

Secondary tags have the ability to theme the border, although the border is not visible by default in the Salt theme.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="Bordered" />

## With icon

Use an icon inside a tag to visually reinforce its content for quick recognition. Icons should be displayed before the label.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="WithIcon" />

## Categories

To differentiate between different category colors, set a category by passing a value from 1 to 20 to the `category` prop.

Note that if a category outside the range is passed, the styles will default to category 1.

Be sure not to rely on color only when using category colors. More information can be found in the [tag accessibility section](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/tag/accessibility)

### Best practices

- Be consistent when assigning category colors. For example, avoid assigning two different category colors to the same piece of metadata.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="Categories" />

## Tag in card

When using more than one tag next to each other, for example in a Card, apply `--salt-spacing-50` between them.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="TagInCard" />
