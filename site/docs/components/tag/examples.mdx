## Primary

Primary tags feature subtle background colors by default, making them ideal for presenting information or content without being overly attention-grabbing.

To add an optional border, simply pass the `bordered` prop to the component.

### Best practices

- Ensure tag colors are consistent with their associated categories.
- Be mindful that using an excessive number of colors can impose a heavy cognitive load on some users.

Secondary tags are generally used to emphasize or highlight specific content. These tags use a bold background color to draw more attention and make the highlighted content stand out.

## Categories

To differentiate between different categories, set a category by passing a value from 1 to 20 to the `category` prop.

Note that if a category outside the range is passed, the styles will default to category 1
