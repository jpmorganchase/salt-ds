## Variants

Tag has two variants: primary and secondary. The primary variant is set by default. Set to secondary with `variant=”secondary”`.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="Variants" />

## Bordered

To add a border to tag, simply pass the `bordered` prop to the component.

Secondary tags have the ability to theme the border, although the border is not visible by default in the Salt theme.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="Bordered" />

## With icon

Use an icon inside a tag to visually reinforce its content for quick recognition. Icons should be displayed before the label.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="WithIcon" />

## Categories

Set a category color by passing a value from 1 to 20 to the `category` prop.

Note that if a category outside the range is passed, the styles will default to category 1.

Don't rely on color only when using category colors. For more information about making tags accessible, refer to the [accessibility guidelines for tags](/salt/components/tag/accessibility).

### Best practices

- Be consistent when assigning category colors. 
- Avoid assigning two different category colors to the same piece of metadata.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="Categories" />

## Tag in card

When using more than one tag next to each other, for example in a Card, apply `--salt-spacing-50` between them.

<LivePreview componentName="tag" exampleName="TagInCard" />
