    <LivePreview componentName="dialog" exampleName="Default" >
      ### Default

      The dialog displays with a title, content area, and action bar. The component is modal, meaning it prevents interaction with the rest of the UI while open and must be addressed by clicking one of the action buttons or dismissing with the close button. If the content of the dialog extends beyond the end of the screen, the `DialogContent` area will become scrollable.

        <LivePreview componentName="dialog" exampleName="Accent" >
    ### Accent

    For default dialogs, you can pass the `accent` prop to `DialogTitle` which accepts a boolean to render an accent bar in the title of the dialog. You cannot render the accent bar when a status is also being rendered.

    <LivePreview componentName="dialog" exampleName="CloseButton" >
    ### Close Button

You can also render the `DialogCloseButton` as a child of the `Dialog` component to render a close button in the top right corner of the dialog. You can pass the `onClick` prop like with any `Button` component to handle the close button click.
