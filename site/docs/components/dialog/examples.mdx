## Default

The dialog displays with a title, content area, and action bar. The component is modal, meaning it prevents interaction with the rest of the UI while open and must be addressed by clicking one of the action buttons or dismissing with the close button. If the content of the dialog extends beyond the end of the screen, the `DialogContent` area will become scrollable.

<LivePreview componentName="dialog" exampleName="Sizes" >

## Sizes

`Dialog` has 3 sizes: `small`, `medium` and `large`. The size you should choose depends on the amount of content you have. The widths of all three dialog sizes are responsive to the Salt breakpoints. This ensures the dialog remains entirely visible in the viewport and its size is optimized for the viewport size (e.g., dialogs appear larger within smaller viewports for ease of visibility).

Choose the appropriate dialog size for the scenario.

### Best practices

Dialog sizes are typically used for different scenarios:

- Small dialogs are used for simple alerts, quick selections or confirmations that require either no or quick action from the user.
- Medium dialogs contain additional components or layouts such as grouped preferences that require increased user input.
- Large dialogs usually contain more complex layouts and can display a series of tasks to complete, such as a form within a wizard.
