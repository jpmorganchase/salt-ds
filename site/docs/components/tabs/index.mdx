data:
  description: "`Tabs` allow users to move between different views of related content without leave the current page. A tab strip includes at least two tabs. Only one tab is  actively engaged at a time and is differentiated from inactive tabs by a colored indicator either on the top or bottom edge of the tab, depending on the variant. Tab strips can cover the full width of the page or be limited to content areas within components such as dialogs, cards, and drawers."
