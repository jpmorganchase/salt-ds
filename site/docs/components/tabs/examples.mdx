## Appearance

Two different appearances are available for tabs: Bordered and Transparent.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="Appearance" />

## Divider and inset

Tabs can be shown with a divider or inset to help create visual alignment in your UI,

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="DividerAndInset" />

## With icon

[Icons](../icon) are optional and appear to the left of the label text. An icon can effectively signify the tabâ€™s purpose, as it relates to its underlying content. Additional visual aid makes it easier for users to locate tabs.

### Best practices

Ensure that icon descriptors are used consistently across all tabs within the strip. This helps keep the tabs within the strip equally weighted.

## With badge

Tabs can feature a [badge](../badge) that serves as a visual cue. They can inform users of additional context, notifications, or new content.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="WithBadge" />

## Overflow

When there are too many tabs to fit in the tabstrip, an overflow menu appears. The overflow menu contains a list of all tabs that are not visible in the tabstrip. Users can access the overflow menu by clicking the chevron icon on the right side of the tabstrip or navigating using the arrow keys.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="Overflow" />

## Add a new tab

Buttons can be nested inside `TabBar` to provide related actions e.g. adding a new tab.

### Best practices

- Provide enough space to display several newly added tabs before overflow is enabled.
- Set the new tab to be the active tab when it is added.
- `useAriaAnnouncer` should be used to provide feedback to screen reader users.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="AddANewTab" />

## Closable tabs

`TabAction`s can be used to add actions to tabs e.g. closing a tab. When closing a tab, a warning dialog may be used when closing a tab will result in data loss.

### Best practices

- Don't use closable tabs for tabs that are essential to the user's workflow.
- Don't allow users to close the last tab in a tabstrip.
- `useAriaAnnouncer` should be used to provide feedback to screen reader users.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="ClosableTabs" />

## Disabled tabs

Tabs can be set as disabled using the `disabled` prop.

<LivePreview componentName="tabs" exampleName="DisabledTabs" />

## Active color

Tabs supports three active colors: "primary", "secondary" and "tertiary".
