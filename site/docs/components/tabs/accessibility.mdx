## Best practices

Any focusable elements included in the tab content will need to be checked and tested accordingly.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">
-	If focus is on outside of tabs, Tab enters focus into tabs.
-	If focus is on a tab item, Tab exits the tab component and place focus onto the next element within the tabbing order.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">
  - If focus is inside a tab component, this action moves focus to the previous
  element in the tabbing order.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">
  - If focus is on tab hover state, this action selects a tab item.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left arrow / Right arrow">
  - This action moves focus between tab items in tab bar.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up arrow / Down arrow">
  - This action moves focus between tab items in an overflow menu list.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Home">
  - If focus is on a tab, Home moves focus to the first tab.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="End">
- If focus is on a tab, End moves focus to the last tab.
</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
