## Best practices

Any focusable elements included in the tab content will need to be checked and tested accordingly.

## Axe false positives

Axe flags a few false positives that do not impact the accessibility of Tabs:

### Certain ARIA roles must contain particular children ([aria-required-children](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-required-children))

This is flagged in two scenarios:

- When an overflow menu is present. `tabIndex={-1}` is applied to the overflow menu to prevent it being tabbable.
- When `TabNextAction` is present. `TabNextAction` follows the experimental example of [Tabs with Action Buttons](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/examples/tabs-actions/) which causes the action to be a descendant of the tab list.

### Scrollable region must have keyboard access ([scrollable-region-focusable](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/scrollable-region-focusable))

- When an overflow menu is present. `tabIndex={-1}` is applied to the overflow menu to prevent it being tabbable.

### ARIA attributes must conform to valid names ([aria-valid-attr](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-valid-attr))

- When `TabNextAction` is present. `TabNextAction` uses [`aria-actions`](https://pr-preview.s3.amazonaws.com/w3c/aria/pull/1805.html#aria-actions) which is still in a draft state and is not recognised by Axe.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">
-	If focus is on outside of tabs, Tab enters focus into tabs.
-	If focus is on a tab item, Tab exits the tab component and place focus onto the next element within the tabbing order.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">
  - If focus is inside a tab component, this action moves focus to the previous
  element in the tabbing order.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">
  - If focus is on tab hover state, this action selects a tab item.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left arrow / Right arrow">
  - This action moves focus between tab items in tab bar.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up arrow / Down arrow">
  - This action moves focus between tab items in an overflow menu list.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Home">
  - If focus is on a tab, Home moves focus to the first tab.
</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="End">
- If focus is on a tab, End moves focus to the last tab.
</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
