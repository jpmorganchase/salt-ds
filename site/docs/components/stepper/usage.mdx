## Using the components

### When to use

- When there are separate steps within a process, such as a wizard or a multistep form.
- When you want to split a process into distinct, bite-sized sections that are less daunting than lengthy forms.

### When not to use

- When there are fewer than three steps in a process.
- As navigation; users cannot interact with the steps.

## Content

Step labels never truncate, only wrap. Therefore, ensure they're short and self-explanatory.
