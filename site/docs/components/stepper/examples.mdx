  ## Basic

  The `Stepper` component accepts `Step` components as children.
  You can change 
  
  <LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="Basic" />

  ## Orientation

    ### Horizontal (default)
    <LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="OrientationHorizontal" />

    ### Vertical
    <LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="OrientationVertical" />

  ## Stage + Status

  The `Step` component changes based on the `stage` and `status` props.
  In case they are both set, `status` will take precedence over `stage`.
  These 2 props control various aspects of the component, such as:
  icon selection, description text color and track (connector) style.

  ## Nesting

  When using the `Stepper` component in vertical orientation, you can nest `Step` components inside each other.
  When done so, the parent `Step` renders another `Stepper` and places the nested `Steps` (children) inside it.
  Additionally an expand button is added to expand and collapse the substeps.
  Steps which contain active step children are to have a stage of `inprogress`.

  ## Hook

  The `Stepper` and `Step` component are purely presentational components.
  If you want to control the state of the `Stepper` you can utilize the `useStepReducer` hook.
  The hook is quite smart

  <LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="Hook" />

  ## Hook Advanced
  
  The `useStepReducer` hook is smart! If you add `stage: 'active'` to a step, it will automatically
  determine the stages of all other steps, both before and after the active one.
  I call it `autoStage`. Inside the state object, you can find useful properties: 
  `steps`, `flatSteps`, `activeStep`, `previousStep`, `nextStep`, `started` and `ended`.
