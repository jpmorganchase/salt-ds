## Orientation

### Horizontal (default)

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="Horizontal" />

### Vertical

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="Vertical" />

## Stage + Status

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="StageStatus" />

The `Step` component's appearance depends on its `stage` and `status` props.
When both are set, `status` takes precedence over `stage`. These props control:

- Icon selection
- Description text color
- Track (connector) style

## Nested Steps

The `Stepper` component supports nested steps when used in vertical orientation.
You can nest `Step` components within other `Step` components to create hierarchical step structures.

### Behavior

- When nesting steps, the parent `Step` automatically renders a new `Stepper` containing its child steps
- An expand/collapse button appears on parent steps to toggle visibility of nested steps
- Parent steps containing the active child step are automatically set to `inprogress` state

### Limitations

- Nested steps are only supported in vertical orientation

## Controlled Stepper

The `Stepper` and `Step` component are primarily presentational components.
If you want to control the state of the `Stepper` you can utilize the `useStepperReducer` hook.

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="Reducer" />

The `useStepperReducer` hook provides intelligent management of step stages in a linear process.

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="ReducerAdvanced" />

Here's how it works:

- **Automatic Staging**:

  - By setting `stage: 'active'` on any step, the hook automatically determines the stages of all other steps, both before and after the active step.

- **State Object**:

  - The state object returned by the hook includes several useful properties:
    - `steps`: The list of all steps.
    - `flatSteps`: A flattened version of the steps.
    - `activeStep`: The currently active step.
    - `previousStep`: The step immediately before the active step.
    - `nextStep`: The step immediately after the active step.
    - `started`: A boolean indicating if the process has started.
    - `ended`: A boolean indicating if the process has ended.

- **Dispatch Method**:
  - Similar to the native `useReducer` hook, the `dispatch` method accepts an action object with a `type`.
  - Supported action types include:
    - `'next'`: Move to the next step.
    - `'previous'`: Move to the previous step.
    - `'status/warning'`: Set the status of the active step to `'warning'`.
    - `'status/error'`: Set the status of the active step to `'error'`.
    - `'status/clear'`: Reset the status of the active step to `undefined`.
