## Orientation

### Horizontal (default)

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="Horizontal" />

### Vertical

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="Vertical" />

## Stage + Status

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="StageStatus" />

The `Step` component changes based on the `stage` and `status` props.
In case they are both set, `status` will take precedence over `stage`.
These 2 props control various aspects of the component, such as:
icon selection, description text color and track (connector) style.

## Nested Steps

When using the `Stepper` component in vertical orientation, you can nest
`Step` components other `Step` components. When done so, the parent `Step`
renders another `Stepper` and places the nested `Steps` (children) inside of
it. Additionally an expand button is added on the parent `Step` to expand or
collapse the substeps. The parent Step containing the active Step child
children are to have a stage of `inprogress`. Nested steps are not supported
for the horizontal orientation.

## Controlled Stepper

The `Stepper` and `Step` component are primarily presentational components.
If you want to control the state of the `Stepper` you can utilize the `useStepReducer` hook.

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="Reducer" />

The `useStepReducer` hook provides intelligent management of step stages in a linear process.

<LivePreview componentName="stepper" exampleName="ReducerAdvanced" />

Here's how it works:

- **Automatic Staging**:

  - By setting `stage: 'active'` on any step, the hook automatically determines the stages of all other steps, both before and after the active step.

- **State Object**:

  - The state object returned by the hook includes several useful properties:
    - `steps`: The list of all steps.
    - `flatSteps`: A flattened version of the steps.
    - `activeStep`: The currently active step.
    - `previousStep`: The step immediately before the active step.
    - `nextStep`: The step immediately after the active step.
    - `started`: A boolean indicating if the process has started.
    - `ended`: A boolean indicating if the process has ended.

- **Dispatch Method**:
  - Similar to the native `useReducer` hook, the `dispatch` method accepts an action object with a `type`.
  - Supported action types include:
    - `'next'`: Move to the next step.
    - `'previous'`: Move to the previous step.
    - `'status/warning'`: Set the status of the active step to `'warning'`.
    - `'status/error'`: Set the status of the active step to `'error'`.
    - `'status/clear'`: Reset the status of the active step to `undefined`.
    - `'goto'`: Set the `activeStep`
