## Best practices

- Keep the use of tooltips to a minimum and use only when providing extra (non-essential) information for the user.
- Focus does not move to the tooltip. Since a tooltip does not receive focus, do not include interactive elements in the tooltip as the user cannot access them.
- Only one tooltip should be displayed at a time.
- Keep the text for a tooltip short and concise.
- Avoid rich content such as bold text, italics, headings, icons, etc. as these will not be conveyed through `aria-describedby`.
- Do not use a timeout to hide the tooltip.

## Anti-Pattern

Avoid applying a tooltip to non-interactive elements. As a rule, non-operable elements should not receive keyboard focus to avoid confusion and unnecessary navigation steps.
A common anti-pattern is to use an (i) icon (or another non-interative element) as the tooltip anchor however this is not recommended for the following reasons:

- Icons (and other non-interative elements) do not receive focus by default.
- Adding `tabindex` to make the icon focusable introduces an additional tab stop.
- An (i) icon or non-interative element will not provide an appropriate programmatic association to what the tooltip is visually associated with. These tooltips become an orphaned note that screen readers announce out of context.
- Screen readers are designed to announce tooltips when a user focuses on an interactive element. When a tooltip is attached to a static element (even using `tabindex`) Screen readers may not reliably announce its content as it is not part of the expected interaction model.

Note: When the content of a tooltip is not about an interactive UI element, consider adding the message directly on the page or use an [`Overlay`](../overlay), [`Dialog`](../dialog), or [`Banner`](../banner) instead.

## Mobile Consideration

Standard tooltips do not display on touch-only devices when attached to [`Links`](../link), [`Buttons`](../button) or non-interative elements and there is currently no workaround. That said, tooltips should display when attached to a [`Form Field`](../form-field).

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

    - Tooltips do not receive focus, so Tab does not move focus to the tooltip. Instead, Tab moves focus to the tooltip trigger element to display the tooltip.

  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Escape">

    - If the tooltip is displayed, pressing Escape dismisses the tooltip.

  </KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
