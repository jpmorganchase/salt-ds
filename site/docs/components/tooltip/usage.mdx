### When to use Tooltip

- When you want to display a brief message to the user that provides additional information about a UI element.

### When not to use Tooltip

- When the content contains interactive elements, like a link, input, or button. Consider always making this content visible or use an [Overlay](../overlay) or a [Dialog](../dialog) instead.

- When there is information that the user needs to know to complete a task. Important help text should always be visible and not hidden from the user.

- When the message always needs to be visible. Instead, place the message directly on the page.

- When the message is not about a UI element. Consider adding the message directly on the page or use an [Overlay](../overlay), a [Dialog](../dialog), or a [Banner](../banner) instead.

### Content

The Tooltip content will never truncate. It should be short and self-explanatory. If a longer message is needed, consider adding it to the page so it is always visible.

### Import

```js
import { Tooltip } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Tooltip" />
