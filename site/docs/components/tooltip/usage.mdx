## Using the component

### When to use

- When you want to display a brief message to the user that provides additional information about a UI element.

### When not to use

- When the content contains interactive elements, such as a link, input or button. Consider always making this content visible or using [`Overlay`](../overlay) or [`Dialog`](../dialog) instead.
- When there's information that the user needs to know to complete a task. Important help text should always be visible to the user.
- When the message always needs to be visible. Instead, place the message directly on the page.
- When the message isn't about a UI element. Consider adding the message directly on the page or using [`Overlay`](../overlay), [`Dialog`](../dialog), or [`Banner`](../banner) instead.

## Content

Tooltip content will never truncate. It should be short and self-explanatory. If a longer message is necessary, consider adding it to the page so it's always visible.

## Import

To import `Tooltip` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Tooltip } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props
