## Using the package

### When to use

When you want to use the Salt theme with AG Grid.

### When not to use

When you want to use a component that is not related to AG Grid. Instead, use Grid.

## Import

Make sure to install the necessary AG Grid packages. You will need to install `ag-grid-react@28`. You should also install any [packages](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/packages/) and [modules](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/modules/) that are necessary for your project, such as `ag-grid-community` and `ag-grid-enterprise`.

To install the `@salt-ds/ag-grid-theme` package, run the command appropriate to your environment:

```js
yarn add @salt-ds/ag-grid-theme
```

```js
npm install @salt-ds/ag-grid-theme
```

### Import Salt AG Grid theme

To import the Salt AG Grid theme, use:

```js
import "ag-grid-community/dist/styles/ag-grid.css";
import "@salt-ds/ag-grid-theme/salt-ag-theme.css";
```

Then wrap your AG Grid with the corresponding class names shown below:

```js
<div
  className="REPLACE_ME_WITH_CORRECT_CLASS"
  style={{ height: 400, width: 600 }}
>
  <AgGridReact rowData={rowData} columnDefs={columnDefs} />
</div>
```

For light [mode](/salt/foundations/modes), use these CSS class names for each [density](/salt/foundations/density):

```js
.ag-theme-salt-high-compact-light
.ag-theme-salt-high-light
.ag-theme-salt-medium-light
.ag-theme-salt-low-light
.ag-theme-salt-touch-light
```

For dark [mode](/salt/foundations/modes), use these CSS class names for each [density](/salt/foundations/density):

```js
.ag-theme-salt-high-compact-dark
.ag-theme-salt-high-dark
.ag-theme-salt-medium-dark
.ag-theme-salt-low-dark
.ag-theme-salt-touch-dark
```

For variants, use these CSS class names:

```js
.ag-theme-salt-variant-secondary
.ag-theme-salt-variant-zebra
```

For editable fields, add the class name `.editable-cell` to the `cellClass` array in your column definition.

For fields displaying numeric values, add the class name `.numeric-cell` to the `cellClass` array in your column definition.
