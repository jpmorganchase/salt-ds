## Adapters

To integrate your date framework with Salt components and enable support for locales or timezones, defining a date adapter is essential. Salt provides date adapters for the most popular date frameworks, which you can extend or use as a foundation to create your own custom adapter.

- **[Day.js](https://day.js.org/)**: Recommended for its small footprint, this library returns immutable Day.js objects.
- **[date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)**: Ideal for comprehensive date manipulation, it returns native JavaScript `Date` objects.
- **[Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html)**: A modern successor to Moment.js, it returns Luxon objects.
- **[Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/)**: A legacy library that is no longer actively maintained.

## Min/Max Dates

Use `LocalizationProvider` to change the min/max dates for the date adapter. These represent the fallback dates when no
min/max date is provided by the component.

In this example, date selection is limited to 3 months.
