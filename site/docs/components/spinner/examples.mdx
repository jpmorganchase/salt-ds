    ### Size (default)

    The default spinner is typically used for widget loading experiences.

    For the default size, set the `size` prop to `”default”` or leave it as `undefined`.

    ### Loading

    Center spinner in the middle of a page or content that is loading.

    We recommend placing a scrim underneath a spinner during full page loading to obscure the underlying content. This prevents keyboard or mouse interactions from reaching this content until the scrim and spinner are closed by the user or system.

    ### Partial Loading

    When updating only a portion of a page, position the spinner within that specific area.
