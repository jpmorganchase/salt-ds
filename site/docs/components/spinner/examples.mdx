## Small

The small spinner is used for embedding in individual components (e.g., button or input) that require dynamic loading experiences.

For the small size set the `size` prop to `"small"`.

<LivePreview componentName="spinner" exampleName="Small" />

## Medium (default)

You would typically use the medium spinner for widget loading experiences.

For the medium size, set the `size` prop to `”medium”` or leave it as `undefined`.

<LivePreview componentName="spinner" exampleName="Medium" />

## Large

The large spinner is useful for full-screen loading experiences.

For the large size, set the `size` prop to `”large”`.

<LivePreview componentName="spinner" exampleName="Large" />

## Loading

Center the spinner in the middle of a page or content that's loading.

<LivePreview componentName="spinner" exampleName="Loading" />

## Partial loading

When updating only a portion of a page, position the spinner within that specific area.

<LivePreview componentName="spinner" exampleName="LoadingPartial" />
