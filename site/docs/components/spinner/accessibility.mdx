## Best practices

- Improve accessibility by customizing the `aria-label` to provide additional context about what is loading, for example, `aria-label="loading settings panel"`.
- Screen-reader users will hear the `aria-label` at a regular interval, which you can customize using the `announcerInterval` property.
- After a set timeout, the component will stop announcing the `aria-label`, which you can customize using the `announcerTimeout` property.
- Screen-reader users will hear a completion message when the spinner unmounts to indicate that loading has finished. You can customize this using the `completionAnnouncement` prop or disable it by setting `completionAnnouncement={null}`.
