### Best practices

- Improve accessibility by customizing the `aria-label` to provide additional context about what is loading, for example, `aria-label="loading settings panel"`.

- The `aria-label` will be announced to screen-reader users at a regular interval which can be customised using the `announcerInterval` property.

- After a set timeout the component will stop announcing the `aria-label`, this can be customised using the `announcerTimeout` property

- A completion message will be announced to screen reader users when the spinner is unmounted to indicate that loading had completed. This can be customised using the `completionAnnouncement` prop or disabled by setting `completionAnnouncement={null}`
