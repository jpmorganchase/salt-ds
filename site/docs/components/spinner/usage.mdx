### How to use Spinner

#### When to use Spinner

- To indicate that content is loading.

- To reassure the user that the system is still working.

- For full screen and widget loading experiences.

- For actions that you expect will take between 1-9 seconds to load or where it is not possible to determine the length of time remaining.

- For more guidance on duration see the Salt [duration foundation recommendations](/salt/foundations/duration)

#### When not to use Spinner

- - Don't use for actions that will run for a determinable length of time. Use Progress component instead.

Don't use for actions which you think could take 10 seconds or more. Use Progress component instead.
