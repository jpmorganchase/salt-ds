### How to use the `Spinner` component

#### When to use `Spinner`

- To indicate that content is loading and reassure the user that the system is still working.
- For actions that you expect will take 1–9 seconds to load or for processes that will take an indeterminate amount of time to complete.

#### When not to use `Spinner`

- For actions that will run for a determinable length of time. Instead, use [`Progress`](/salt/components/progress).

- For a process that is taking longer than 10 seconds to complete, as this is the point at which any attempt for a system to respond should finish, and a status message should display instead. For further guidance, view the [Salt duration foundation](/salt/foundations/duration).

### Import

To import `Spinner` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Spinner } from "@salt-ds/core";
```
