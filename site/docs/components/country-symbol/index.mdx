title: Country symbol
data:
  description: "Country symbols display an icon that represents the flag of a country or intergovernmental organization. You can use country symbols individually or as a complete package. The country symbols are stylized and representative, so users are more likely to recognize them at smaller sizes, and they maintain their character within the circular form."
