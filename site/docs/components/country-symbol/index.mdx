title: Country Symbol
data:
  description: Country Symbol displays an icon that represents the flag of a country or intergovernmental organization. You can use Country Symbols individually or as a complete package. The Country Symbols are stylized and representative, so users are more likely to recognize them at smaller sizes, and they maintain their character within the circular form.
