title: Country Symbol
data:
  description: The Country Symbol component displays an icon that represents the flag of a country or inter-governmental organization. You can use Country Symbols individually or as a complete package. The Country Symbols are stylized and representative—so users are more likely to recognize them at smaller sizes, and they maintain their character within the circular form.
