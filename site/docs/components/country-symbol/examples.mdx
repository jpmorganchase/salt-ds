## Basic usage

Import and use each country symbol individually.

<LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="BasicUsage" />

## Sharp variants

Import and use the sharp version of each country symbol individually using the `_Sharp` suffix (e.g. `TT` becomes `TT_Sharp` for the sharp variant).

<LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="SharpVariants" />

## Size

You can change the size of each country symbol using the `size` property which acts as a multiplier for the base size, as described in the [country symbol foundation](/salt/foundations/assets/country-symbols). The base size of the country symbol is based on the active density as described in the [size foundation](/salt/foundations/size).

<LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="Size" />

## All country symbols

The following example shows all the available country symbols. You can import each component individually using its respective country code.

For example, the country symbol for Belgium has the code BE, which you can import as follows:

```jsx
import { BE } from "@salt-ds/countries";
```

<LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="AllCountrySymbols" />

## Lazy loading

When importing many country symbol components at once, such as with a list, you may not want all the components in your initial bundle size. Instead, you can lazily load the country symbol components using [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense), alongside the `LazyCountrySymbol` component. `LazyCountrySymbol` takes a `code` prop to load the appropriate country symbol component.

<LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="LazyLoading" />

## CSS background image

You can also use country symbol as a background image in CSS from `"@salt-ds/countries/saltCountries.css"` or `"@salt-ds/countries/saltSharpCountries.css"`, then specify the country code prefixed with `saltCountry-` or `saltCountrySharp-`, e.g., `saltCountry-AD`, `saltCountrySharp-GB-SCT`.

<LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="CssBackgroundImage" />
