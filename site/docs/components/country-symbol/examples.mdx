    ### Basic usage

    You should import and use each country symbol individually.

  </LivePreview>
  <LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="Size">

    ### Size

    You can change the size of each country symbol using the `size` property which acts as a multiplier for the base size, as described in the [scale foundation](/salt/foundations/scale). The base size of the country symbol is based on the active density as described in the [size foundation](/salt/foundations/size).

  <LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="AllCountrySymbols">

    ### All country symbols

    The following example shows all the available country symbols. You can import each component individually using its respective country code.

    For example, the country symbol for Belgium has the code BE, which you can import as follows:

    ```jsx
    import { BE } from '@salt-ds/countries';
    ```

    ### Lazy loading

    When importing many country symbol components at once, such as with a list, you may not want all the components in your initial bundle size. Instead, you can lazily load the country symbol components using [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense), alongside the `LazyCountrySymbol` component. `LazyCountrySymbol` takes a `code` prop to load the appropriate country symbol component.

    ### As CSS background image

    You can also use country symbol as background image in CSS from `"@salt-ds/countries/saltCountries.css"`, then specify country code prefixed with `saltCountry-`, e.g., `saltCountry-AD`, `saltCountry-GB-SCT`.
