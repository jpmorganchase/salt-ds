## Basic usage

Import and use each country symbol individually.

<LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="BasicUsage" />

We include all countries and subdivisions that appear in the International Organization for Standardization [(ISO) 3166-1 standard] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes). Though we use the country names, alpha-2 codes and corresponding alphabetical order from ISO, our symbols derive from whichever flag the official [United Nations list] (https://data.un.org/en/index.html) provides for each country. Of the 249 countries currently in the ISO list, 193 are sovereign states with UN membership. We also include the EU symbol, due to its economic importance.

While the ISO country codes correlate with top-level domains (TLD) on the internet, for example, they don't always map perfectly to languages, national currencies or telephone country codes. So they may not always be the best corresponding visuals, given cultural, historical and political sensitivities. Since the symbols are decorative, there may be accessible ways to convey the same information.   

## Sharp variants

Import and use the sharp version of each country symbol individually using the `_Sharp` suffix (e.g. `TT` becomes `TT_Sharp` for the sharp variant).

<LivePreview componentName="country-symbol" exampleName="SharpVariants" />

## Size

You can change the size of each country symbol using the `size` property which acts as a multiplier for the base size, as described in the [country symbol foundation](/salt/foundations/assets/country-symbols). The base size of the country symbol is based on the active density as described in the [size foundation](/salt/foundations/size).

## All country symbols

The following example shows all the available country symbols. You can import each component individually using its respective country code.

For example, the country symbol for Belgium has the code BE, which you can import as follows:

```jsx
import { BE } from "@salt-ds/countries";
```

## Lazy loading

When importing many country symbol components at once, such as with a list, you may not want all the components in your initial bundle size. Instead, you can lazily load the country symbol components using [React Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense), alongside the `LazyCountrySymbol` component. `LazyCountrySymbol` takes a `code` prop to load the appropriate country symbol component.

## CSS background image

You can also use country symbol as a background image in CSS from `"@salt-ds/countries/saltCountries.css"` or `"@salt-ds/countries/saltSharpCountries.css"`, then specify the country code prefixed with `saltCountry-` or `saltCountrySharp-`, e.g., `saltCountry-AD`, `saltCountrySharp-GB-SCT`.
