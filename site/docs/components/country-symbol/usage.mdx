## Using the components

To reduce the core package's bundle size, country symbols are in a separate package that you should first install using:

`npm install @salt-ds/countries` or `yarn add @salt-ds/countries`

### When to use

To display an icon that represents the flag of a country or territory.

### When not to use

While the ISO country codes do correlate with top-level domains (TLD) on the internet, for example, they don't always map perfectly to languages, national currencies or telephone country codes. So, sometimes they may not be the best corresponding visuals, given cultural, historical and political sensitivities. Regardless, since the symbols are decorative, there must be correct labels and accessible text to convey the information.

## Import

To import an individual country symbol from the `countries` Salt package, use its country code:

```js
import { AD, GB_ENG } from "@salt-ds/countries";
```

To import `LazyCountrySymbol` from the `countries` Salt package, use:

```js
import { LazyCountrySymbol } from "@salt-ds/countries";
```

To import a "sharp" variant from the `countries` Salt package, append `_Sharp` to the desired country code:

```js
import { AD_Sharp, GB_ENG_Sharp } from "@salt-ds/countries";
```
