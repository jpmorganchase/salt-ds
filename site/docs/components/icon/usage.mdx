### Using the Icon components

#### When to use Icons

- Use an icon to aid recognition and to help users make choices by providing context (e.g. an office phone number vs mobile phone number in contact information).

#### When not to use Icons

- When you need an interactive icon. Instead, use [Button](/salt/components/Button) (CTA, Primary or Secondary variant).

### Import

To import an individual Icon from the icons package use:

```js
import { AddDocumentIcon } from "@salt-ds/icons";
```

To import Icon from the icons package for creating custom SVG Icons use:

```js
import { Icon } from "@salt-ds/icons";
```
