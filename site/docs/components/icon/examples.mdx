    ### Basic icon

    You should individually import and use from the `@salt-ds/icons`
    package.

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="IconSize">
    ### Icon size

    You can change the size of each icon using the `size` property, which acts as a multiplier for the base iconâ€™s size, as described in the [scale foundation](/salt/foundations/scale). The base size of the icon depends on the active density as described in the [size foundation](/salt/foundations/size).

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="IconTypes">
    ### Icon types

    We provide two icon types: default and solid. Most icons will have both versions, with some exceptions as described in the [iconography foundation](/salt/foundations/iconography). The outline style is the default icon type. Use the solid icon for additional emphasis or to represent a toggled "on" state.

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="IconColor">
    ### Icon color
    
    To override the default color of the icon, use the `color` prop. This allows you to set the color to `primary`, `secondary` or `inherit`.

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="CustomIcon">
    ### Custom Icons

    If you need a custom SVG icon, use the `Icon` component. `Icon` has the same API as the native `<svg>` element. Whenever you add a custom icon, pass an `aria-label` to `Icon`.

    ### Custom colors
    If you need to use a color other than "primary" or "secondary", use `color="inherit"` or use CSS to change the icon's `fill`.
