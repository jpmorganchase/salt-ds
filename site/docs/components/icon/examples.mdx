## Basic icon

You should individually import and use from the `@salt-ds/icons`
package.

<LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="BasicIcon" />

## Icon size

You can change the size of each icon using the `size` property, which acts as a multiplier for the base icon’s size, as described in the [iconography foundation](/salt/foundations/assets). The base size of the icon depends on the active density as described in the [size foundation](/salt/foundations/size).

<LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="IconSize" />

## Icon types

We provide two icon types: default and solid. Most icons will have both versions, with some exceptions as described in the [iconography foundation](/salt/foundations/assets). The outline style is the default icon type. Use the solid icon for additional emphasis or to represent a toggled "on" state.

<LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="IconTypes" />

## Icon color

To override the default color of the icon, use the `color` prop. This allows you to set the color to `primary`, `secondary` or `inherit`.

<LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="IconColor" />

## Custom icons

If you need a custom SVG icon, use the `Icon` component. `Icon` has the same API as the native `<svg>` element. Whenever you add a custom icon, pass an `aria-label` to `Icon`.

<LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="CustomIcon" />

## Custom colors

If you need to use a color other than "primary" or "secondary", use `color="inherit"` or use CSS to change the icon's `fill`.

<LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="CustomColors" />

### CSS background image

You can also use icon as background image in CSS from `"@salt-ds/icons/saltIcons.css"`, then specify icon name prefixed with `saltIcons-`, e.g., `saltIcons-AddDocument`.

<LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="CssBackgroundImage" />
