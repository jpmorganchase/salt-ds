    ### Basic Icon

    Icons should be individually imported and used from the `@salt-ds/icons`
    package

  </LivePreview>
  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="Size">
    ### Size

    You can change the size of each Icon using the `size` prop. This is a
    multiplier to be used for the base size. We have a default icon set that
    starts from 12px for high and medium density (MD), then 14px for low density
    (LD), and 16px for touch density (TD). (Since our base size of high density
    (HD)/default is 10px but we donâ€™t allow icons size smaller than 12px. The
    HD/default will start from 12px, and its 2X is 20px, 3X is 30px and onwards
    through the multiples) You have more size choices by adding multiplies to
    2x, 3x, 4x and onwards.

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="SolidIcons">
    ### Solid Icons

    We provide two types of icons: default and solid. Most of our icons will
    have the two versions, except cases in which the icon shape is too narrow to
    have a solid version like plus and loader

    ### Color

    To override the default color of the icon, you can use the `--saltIcon-color` CSS variable.

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="CustomIcon">
    ### Custom Icons

    If you need a custom SVG icon you can use the `Icon` component. `Icon` has the same API as the native `<svg>` element. Whenever you add a custom icon you need to pass an `aria-label` to the `Icon`.
