    ### Basic Icon

    Icons should be individually imported and used from the `@salt-ds/icons`
    package

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="IconSize">
    ### Icon Size

    You can change the size of each icon using the `size` property which acts as a multiplier for the base icon’s size, as described in the [Scale Foundation](/salt/foundations/scale). The base size of Icon is based on the active density as described in the [Size Foundation](/salt/foundations/size).

    ### Icon Types

    We provide two types of icons: default and solid. Most icons will have both versions, with some exceptions as described in the [Iconography Foundation](/salt/foundations/iconography). The outline style is the default icon type. Use the solid icon for additional emphasis or to represent a toggled 'on' state.

    ### Icon Color
    
    To override the default color of the icon, use the `color` prop. This allows you to set the color to `primary`, `secondary` or `inherit`.

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="CustomIcon">
    ### Custom Icons

    If you need a custom SVG icon, use the Icon component. Icon has the same API as the native `<svg>` element. Whenever you add a custom icon, pass an `aria-label` to Icon.

    If you need to use a color other than "primary" or "secondary", use `color="inherit"` or use CSS to change the icon's `fill`.
