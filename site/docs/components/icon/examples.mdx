    package

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="Size">
    ### Icon Size

    You can change the size of each icon using the `size` property which acts as a multiplier for the base icon’s size, as described in the [Scale Foundation](/salt/foundations/scale). The base size of Icon is based on the active density as described in the [Size Foundation](/salt/foundations/size).

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="SolidIcons">
    ### Solid Icons

    We provide two types of icons: default and solid. Most icons will have both versions, with some exceptions as described in the [Iconography Foundation](/salt/foundations/iconography). The outline style is the default icon type. Use the solid icon for additional emphasis or to represent a toggled 'on' state.

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="Color">
    ### Icon Color

    To override the default color of the icon, use the --saltIcon-color CSS variable. This could be necessary to match primary or secondary text. You can find appropriate color variables in the [Typography Foundation](/salt/foundations/typography#color)

  <LivePreview componentName="icon" exampleName="CustomIcon">
    ### Custom Icons

    If you need a custom SVG icon, use the Icon component. Icon has the same API as the native `<svg>` element. Whenever you add a custom icon, pass an `aria-label` to Icon.
