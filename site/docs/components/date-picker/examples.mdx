<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleSelect">

## Single select

The default date picker allows the user to pick a single date, which is committed when it has been typed into the field or selected from the calendar.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithFormField">
## Form field compatibility

You can wrap date picker in a form field when itâ€™s displayed within a form. This provides functionality built into `FormField` for increased accessibility.

For more information, refer to the [form pattern](/salt/patterns/forms).

We recommend using our default date picker format (DD MMM YYYY) as it provides greater clarity and avoids ambiguity when identifying the month.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Range">
## Date range

The Date Range Picker enables selection of start and end dates, using the input fields or two calendars displayed.
We recommend using the form field's label and helper text to instruct the user to select a date range by choosing both a start date and an end date.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithDisabledDates">
## With disabled dates

You can customize the calendar by passing calendar props into `CalendarProps`.
For more information, refer to the [calendar](/salt/components/calendar).
