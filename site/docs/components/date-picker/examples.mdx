## Single date

An uncontrolled `DatePicker`, composed of a `DateInput` and a `Calendar` component, allows users to select a single date when the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "single", without requiring explicit state management in the parent component, making it ideal for simple date selection tasks.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Single" />

## Date range

An uncontrolled `DatePicker`, composed of a `DateInput` and a `Calendar` component, allows users to select a date range when the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "range", without requiring explicit state management in the parent component, making it ideal for selecting start and end dates for various applications.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Range" />

## Single with min/max date

To constrain the selected date within a specific range, use the `minDate` and/or `maxDate` props. If `minDate` is not provided, it defaults to the year 1900. If `maxDate` is undefined, it defaults to the year 2100. This ensures that the selected date remains within the specified range.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithCustomParser" />

## Single with locale

When the `locale` prop is provided, the `DatePicker` component uses it to define the locale, ensuring that date formats, month names, and other locale-specific elements are displayed according to the specified locale.

## Bordered single

A `DatePicker` component with a border provides a visually distinct area for selecting dates, enhancing the user interface by clearly delineating the component boundaries. This styling can improve usability and accessibility by making the calendar controls more noticeable and easier to interact with.

By default, the overlay's open state is uncontrolled and opens only when the calendar button is pressed or down arrow is used. However, you can fully control the overlay's open behavior using the `open` prop. When you control the open state, you also take responsibility for handling the input's focus behavior after a selection is made.
