<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleSelect">

## Single select

The default date picker allows the user to pick a single date, which is committed when it has been typed into the field or selected from the calendar.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithFormField">
## Form field compatibility

You can wrap date picker in a form field when it’s displayed within a form. This provides functionality built into `FormField` for increased accessibility.

For more information, refer to the [form pattern](/salt/patterns/forms).

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithValidation">
## Validation

Date picker can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Range">
## Date range

The Date Range Picker enables selection of start and end dates, using the input fields or two calendars displayed.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="CustomFormatter">
## With custom formatter

You can customize the date picker's placeholder and formatter by changing the `placeholder` and `dateFormatter` props.
Make sure `dateFormatter` is stable to avoid it triggering unintended state resets.
We recommend using our default date picker format (DD MMM YYYY) as it provides greater clarity and avoids ambiguity when identifying the month.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithDisabledDates">
## With disabled dates

You can customize the calendar by passing calendar props into `CalendarProps`.
For more information, refer to the [calendar](/salt/components/calendar).

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="VisibleMonths">
## Visible months

Use the `visibleMonths` prop to customize the number of visible months in the panel for a range date picker. This is useful on smaller viewports.
