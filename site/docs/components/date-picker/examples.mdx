<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleSelect">

## Single select

The default date picker allows the user to pick a single date, which is committed when it has been typed into the field or selected from the calendar.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithFormField">
## Form field compatibility

You can wrap date picker in a form field when itâ€™s displayed within a form. This provides functionality built into `FormField` for increased accessibility.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="CustomFormatter">
## With custom formatter

You can customize the date picker's placeholder and formatter by changing the `placeholder` and `dateFormatter` props.
We recommend using our default date picker format (DD MMM YYYY) as it provides greater clarity and avoids ambiguity when identifying the month.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithDisabledDates">
## With disabled dates

You can customize the calendar by passing calendar props into `CalendarProps`.
