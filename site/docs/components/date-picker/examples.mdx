<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Default">

## Default

The default Date Picker allows the user to pick a single date, which is committed when it has been typed into the field or selected from the calendar.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithFormfield">

## With form field

This Date Picker has a form field label and is configured with validation logic. If an invalid date is entered, the error is detected and a tooltip advises the user of the correct format.

### Best practices

To improve consistency and simplify your messaging, consider recommending just one acceptable date format in the label and/or tooltip â€“ ideally, the one most frequently used in your application.
