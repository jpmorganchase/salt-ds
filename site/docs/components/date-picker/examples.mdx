<Callout title="Note">

All date components requires [LocalizationProvider](/salt/components/localization-provider/examples) to be set up in your application.

</Callout>

## Default

An uncontrolled `DatePicker`, composed of a [DateInputSingle](../DateInput) and a [Calendar](../Calendar) component, allows users to select a single date when the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "single", without requiring explicit state management in the parent component, making it ideal for simple date selection tasks.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Single" />

## Controlled

A controlled `DatePicker`, composed of a [DateInputSingle](../DateInput) and a [Calendar](../Calendar) component, allows users to select a single date when the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "single", with the parent component explicitly managing the date state, providing greater control over the date selection process.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleControlled" />

## Calendar grid view

Use `DatePickerSingleGridPanel` to provide a grid of multiple calendars, enabling the user to select the date from a wider range of visible months.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleGridPanel" />

The `columns` and `numberOfVisibleMonths` properties are responsive, allowing you to adjust the number of calendars or columns at each breakpoint for optimal display on different screen sizes.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-picker"
  exampleName="SingleResponsiveGridPanel"
/>

## Within form field

A `DatePicker` with `selectionVariant` set to "single", inside a `FormField`, provides the field with a visible label, help text, and a status message for validation feedback.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithFormField" />

## Initial error

When used with `FormField`, the `validationStatus` prop can be used to recreate an initial error state.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithInitialError" />

## Min/max date

To constrain the selected date within a specific range, use the `minDate` and/or `maxDate` props. If `minDate` is not provided, it defaults to the year 1900. If `maxDate` is undefined, it defaults to the year 2100. This ensures that the selected date remains within the specified range.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithMinMaxDate" />

## Unselectable dates

Unselectable dates are visually distinct from selectable dates. When a user attempts to select an unselectable date, the calendar displays a tooltip with additional information. To implement this, use the `isDayUnselectable` prop to pass a function that determines whether a day is unselectable and provides the tooltip description.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-picker"
  exampleName="SingleWithUnselectableDates"
/>

## Highlighted dates

Highlighted dates are marked by a triangle in the top right corner, indicating an event associated with that day. When a user hovers over a highlighted date, the calendar displays a tooltip with additional information. To implement this, use the `isDayHighlighted` prop to pass a function that determines whether a day is highlighted and provides the tooltip description.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-picker"
  exampleName="SingleWithHighlightedDates"
/>

## Custom content

The composed nature of the `DatePicker` enables you to control the content of the overlay using the `children` prop. Use the recommended panels or compose them with your own.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithCustomPanel" />

## With today button

The `children` prop enables you to compose additional controls to your Date Picker component, such as a 'Today' button.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithTodayButton" />

## With confirmation

You can change dates upon selection, or apply the selection with additional controls.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithConfirmation" />

## Custom parser

A custom parser can be used to handle specific date formats or shorthand date entries.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithCustomParser" />

## Locale

When the `locale` prop is provided, the `DatePicker` component uses it to define the locale, ensuring that date formats, month names, and other locale-specific elements are displayed according to the specified locale.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithLocaleEnUS" />

## Timezone

Use the `timezone` prop to display the selected date in a specific timezone. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle date and time data across different time zones, ensuring that users can accurately select and view dates based on their local time.

<Callout title="Note">

If you need to work with a date string (e.g., in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format) and display it using a date picker, you don't need to configure a timezone. Simply use the [`dateAdapter.format`](/salt/components/localization-provider/usage#format) and [`dateAdapter.parse`](/salt/components/localization-provider/usage#parse) functions with the same `format` parameter. Pass the formatted date to the `selectedDate` property and retrieve the date using the `onSelectionChange` callback.

</Callout>

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleWithTimezone" />

## Bordered

A `DatePicker` component with a border provides a visually distinct area for selecting dates, enhancing the user interface by clearly delineating the component boundaries. This styling can improve usability and accessibility by making the calendar controls more noticeable and easier to interact with.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleBordered" />

## Uncontrolled open

By default, the overlay's open state is uncontrolled and opens only when the calendar button or down arrow is used. However, it can also be configured to open using the `openOnClick` prop.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="UncontrolledOpen" />

## Controlled open

By default, the overlay's open state is uncontrolled and opens only when the calendar button is pressed or down arrow is used. However, you can fully control the overlay's open behavior using the `open` prop. When you control the open state, you also take responsibility for handling the input's focus behavior after a selection is made.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="ControlledOpen" />
