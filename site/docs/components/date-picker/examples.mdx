<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="SingleSelect">

## Single select

The default date picker allows the user to pick a single date, which is committed when it has been typed into the field or selected from the calendar.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithFormField">
## Form field compatibility

You can wrap date picker in a form field when it’s displayed within a form. This provides functionality built into `FormField` for increased accessibility.

For more information, refer to the [form pattern](/salt/patterns/forms).

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithValidation">
## Validation

Date picker can show validation states (warning, success, error) with the prop `validationStatus`.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Range">
## Date range

The Date Range Picker enables selection of start and end dates, using the input fields or two calendars displayed.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="VisibleMonths">
## Visible months

The Range Picker with prop `visibleMonths={1}` renders a single calendar for a range selection. We recommend using it when the space is limited.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="CustomFormatter">
## With custom formatter

You can customize the date picker's placeholder and formatter by changing the `placeholder` and `dateFormatter` props.
We recommend using our default date picker format (DD MMM YYYY) as it provides greater clarity and avoids ambiguity when identifying the month.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="WithDisabledDates">
## With disabled dates

You can customize the calendar by passing calendar props into `CalendarProps`.
For more information, refer to the [calendar](/salt/components/calendar).
