## Best practices

- Clearly indicate dates that can’t be selected, e.g., weekend, non-trading or other blocked days, if relevant to your use case.
- Consider showing date options in a Dropdown, instead of a Date Picker, if the date or range is pre-determined and can’t be specified by the user.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

    - If focus is above the input, Tab moves focus onto the input and highlights the text. If the input area is empty, Tab displays a text cursor in the input area.
    - If the input is disabled, Tab skips the input.
    - If the input has focus, Tab moves focus to the calendar button, if there is a valid date in a wrong format, it formats the date.
    - If focus is on the calendar button and the panel is open, Tab moves focus to the selected day, current day or first day of the month.
    - If focus is within the panel, Tab moves focus to the next focusable navigation element in the calendar.

  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

    - If focus is on the input, Shift + Tab moves focus out of the component to the previous component in the tab order.
    - If focus is on the calendar button, Shift + Tab moves focus into the input.
    - If focus is within the panel, Shift + Tab  moves focus to the last focusable navigation element in the calendar.

  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter">

    - If focus is on the button Enter toggles the calendar.
    - If focus is on the input, Enter formats the input text as date.

  </KeyboardControl>
