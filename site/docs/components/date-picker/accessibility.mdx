## Best practices

- Wrap `DatePicker` in [`FormField`](/salt/components/form-field) to provide the field with a visible label, help text, and a status message for validation feedback. This will ensure it complies with accessibility guidelines. You can find more information [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).
- Clearly indicate dates that canâ€™t be selected, such as weekends, non-trading days, or other blocked days, if relevant to your use case.
- Consider showing date options in a dropdown instead of a date picker if the date or range is pre-determined and cannot be specified by the user.
- As the `DatePicker` typically composes `DateInput` controls, refer to the accessibility guidance for [DateInput](../date-input/accessibility).

### Focus

- If the `DatePicker` uses `children` to compose other components such as `Calendar`, move focus to the first interactive element within that overlay.
- After a date is selected, provide feedback and move focus appropriately to enhance the user experience.

### Provide instructions and feedback

- Include clear instructions for each date selection.
- Display validation messages and status updates in a way that is accessible to screen readers.

### Announce changes dynamically

- Use `aria-live` regions to announce changes, such as when a date is selected or when the calendar view changes.
- Ensure that screen readers announce the selected dates and any instructions for interacting with the `DatePicker`.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">
    - If focus is above the input, Tab moves focus onto the input and highlights
    the text. If the input area is empty, Tab displays a text cursor in the
    input area. - If the input is disabled, Tab skips the input. - If the input
    has focus, Tab moves focus to the calendar button. If there is a valid date
    in a wrong format, it formats the date. - If focus is on the calendar button
    and the panel is open, Tab moves focus to the selected day, current day, or
    first day of the month. - If focus is within the panel, Tab moves focus to
    the next focusable navigation element in the calendar.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">
    - If focus is on the input, Shift + Tab moves focus out of the component to
    the previous component in the tab order. - If focus is on the calendar
    button, Shift + Tab moves focus into the input. - If focus is within the
    panel, Shift + Tab moves focus to the last focusable navigation element in
    the calendar.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter">
    - If focus is on the button, Enter toggles the calendar. - If focus is on
    the input, Enter formats the input text as a date.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">
    - When the input area has focus, Space inserts a character at the position
    of the text cursor. - If the calendar button has focus, Space toggles the
    calendar.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Right Arrow">
    When the input area has focus: - If text is highlighted, the highlight is
    removed and the text cursor is positioned at the right edge of the
    highlight. - If the text cursor is displayed, it is positioned on the
    alternative side of the following character. If there is no following
    character, there is no effect.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left Arrow">
    When the input area has focus: - If text is in a highlighted state, Left
    Arrow removes the highlight and positions the text cursor at the left edge
    of the highlight. - If the text cursor is visible, Left Arrow positions it
    on the alternative side of the preceding character. If there's no preceding
    character, there's no effect.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Left Arrow / Shift + Right Arrow">
    When the input area has focus, drags selection over text characters, one at
    a time.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Backspace">
    When the input area has focus and: - Text is highlighted, this action
    removes all highlighted characters. - The text cursor is positioned to the
    right of text, this action removes the preceding character.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Alphanumeric/Special keys">
    When the input area has focus, this action inserts the relevant character at
    the position of the text cursor.
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Control + A / Command + A">
    This action highlights all strings within the field.
  </KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
