<Callout title="Note">

All date components requires [LocalizationProvider](/salt/components/localization-provider/examples) to be set up in your application.

</Callout>

## Default

An uncontrolled `DatePicker`, composed of a [DateInputRange](../DateInput) and a [Calendar](../Calendar) component, allows users to select a date range when the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "range", without requiring explicit state management in the parent component, making it ideal for selecting start and end dates for various applications.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Range" />

## Controlled

A controlled `DatePicker`, composed of a [DateInputRange](../DateInput) and a [Calendar](../Calendar) component, allows users to select a date range when the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "range", with the parent component explicitly managing the start and end date states, providing greater control over the date range selection process.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeControlled" />

## Calendar grid view

Use `DatePickerRangeGridPanel` to provide a grid of multiple calendars, enabling the user to select the date from a wider range of visible months.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeGridPanel" />

The `columns` and `numberOfVisibleMonths` properties are responsive, allowing you to adjust the number of calendars or columns at each breakpoint for optimal display on different screen sizes.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-picker"
  exampleName="RangeResponsiveGridPanel"
/>

## Within form field

A `DatePicker` with `selectionVariant` set to "range", inside a `FormField`, provides the field with a visible label, help text, and a status message for validation feedback.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithFormField" />

## Initial error

When used with `FormField`, the `validationStatus` prop can be used to recreate an initial error state.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithInitialError" />

## Disabled dates

Disabled dates are not selectable. To implement this, use the `isDayUnselectable` prop to pass a function that determines whether a day is unselectable and provides the tooltip description.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithDisabledDates" />

## Unselectable dates

Unselectable dates are visually distinct from selectable dates. When a user attempts to select an unselectable date, the calendar displays a tooltip with additional information. To implement this, use the `isDayUnselectable` prop to pass a function that determines whether a day is unselectable and provides the tooltip description.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-picker"
  exampleName="RangeWithUnselectableDates"
/>

## Highlighted dates

Highlighted dates are marked by a triangle in the top right corner, indicating an event associated with that day. When a user hovers over a highlighted date, the calendar displays a tooltip with additional information. To implement this, use the `isDayHighlighted` prop to pass a function that determines whether a day is highlighted and provides the tooltip description.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-picker"
  exampleName="RangeWithHighlightedDates"
/>

## Min/max date

To constrain the selected date within a specific range, use the `minDate` and/or `maxDate` props. If `minDate` is not provided, it defaults to the year 1900. If `maxDate` is undefined, it defaults to the year 2100. This ensures that the selected date remains within the specified range.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithMinMaxDate" />

## Custom content

The composed nature of the `DatePicker` enables you to control the content of the overlay using the `children` prop. Use the recommended panels or compose them with your own.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithCustomPanel" />

## With confirmation

You can change dates upon selection, or apply the selection with additional controls.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithConfirmation" />

## Locale

When the `locale` prop is provided, the `DatePicker` component uses it to define the locale, ensuring that date formats, month names, and other locale-specific elements are displayed according to the specified locale.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithLocaleEsES" />

## Timezone

Use the `timezone` prop to display the selected date range in a specific timezone. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle date and time data across different time zones, ensuring that users can accurately select and view date ranges based on their local time.

<Callout title="Note">

If you just need to take in a date string (e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD` format) and give back the same using the date picker, you don't need to configure timezone. You can use a pair of [`dateAdapter.format`](/salt/components/localization-provider/usage#format) and [`dateAdapter.parse`](/salt/components/localization-provider/usage#parse) functions with the same `format` parameter before passing the date to `selectedDate` and getting the date from `onSelectionChange` callback.

</Callout>

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithTimezone" />

## Bordered

A `DatePicker` component with a border provides a visually distinct area for selecting dates, enhancing the user interface by clearly delineating the component boundaries. This styling can improve usability and accessibility by making the calendar controls more noticeable and easier to interact with.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeBordered" />
