## Using the component

`DatePicker` provides a context to the `children` contained within it and a composable API that enables you to create your own date picker controls.

Salt provides the following `children` for convenience:

- `DatePickerOverlay` - a container component for the content of the `DatePicker` overlay.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Single" />

### Date range selection

When `selectionVariant` is "range":

- `DatePickerRangeInput` - a composable [DateInputRange](../DateInput) pre-wired to the `DatePicker` selection context.
- `DatePickerRangeGridPanel` - composable [Calendar](../Calendar) grid pre-wired to the `DatePicker` selection context.
  - Opt for `DatePickerRangeGridPanel` when dealing with short date ranges or when displaying the dates in-between enhances the user experience.
- `DatePickerRangePanel` - composable dual [Calendar](../Calendar) view pre-wired to the `DatePicker` selection context.
  - Choose `DatePickerRangePanel` for long date ranges or when the focus is primarily on the start and end dates, rather than the dates in-between.

A composable API enables you to use provided child components, such as `DatePickerRangeInput` and `DatePickerRangePanel`.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="Range" />

### Custom overlay content

You can also compose your own overlay content with the provided components.

A composable API enables you to combine the provided child components with your own.

<LivePreview componentName="date-picker" exampleName="RangeWithCustomPanel" />

### When to use

- Use a `DatePicker` component when you need a visual and intuitive interface for selecting single dates or date ranges, making it ideal for financial applications, event scheduling, and project management. In contrast, use a `Dropdown` when the dates are pre-determined, the selection is infrequent, or a compact interface is required, such as selecting a birth year or a specific month in a form.

### Best practices

To improve consistency and simplify your messaging, recommend a single acceptable date format in the form field label and helper textâ€”preferably the one most frequently used in your application.

## Import

To import `DatePicker` from the Salt lab package, use:

```js
import { DatePicker } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```

### Locale

The default locale for Salt's date adapters is "enUS".

`DatePicker` uses the locale of the configured date adapter provided by the nearest [LocalizationProvider] (../LocalizationProvider).
Configuration of locales is date framework specific and may require you to import specific locales from the date library you are using.

For example, if you are using `date-fns`, you may need to import the specific locale you want to use, such as `es` or `frFR`.

The default locale for Salt's date adapters is "enUS".

Refer to the documentation of the date library you are using for information on how to configure other locales.

### Timezone

`DatePicker` accepts a `timezone` prop that defines the timezone.

The default timezone for Salt's components is "default".

Valid values for `timezone` are date framework specific and can be one of the following:

- "default" uses the local timezone of the user's browser.
- "system" uses the timezone of the system running the code.
- "UTC" uses the UTC timezone.
- string uses a specific IANA timezone string, such as "America/New_York" or "Europe/London".
