## Using the component

### When to use

Use a Date Picker when enabling users to filter data that’s displayed on screen, or whenever a specific timeframe or period needs to be selected.

### Best practices

To improve consistency and simplify your messaging, consider recommending just one acceptable date format in the form field label and helper text – ideally, the one most frequently used in your application.

## Import

To import `DatePicker` from the lab Salt package, use:

```js
import { DatePicker } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```

## Props

<PropsTable packageName="lab" componentName="DatePicker" />
