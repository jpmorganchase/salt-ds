### Image

You can pass an image using the `src` property to be used as the Avatar image.

A custom image or SVG can also be passed as the child of the component. Note that for images passed as children, you will also need to handle the fallback logic.

<LivePreview componentName="avatar" exampleName="Initials" >

### Initials

If a photo is not available, the Avatar will fall back to initials or an icon:

- Initials can be used when a photo is unavailable, but profile information is.

- Icon can be used when neither a photo nor profile information are available.

### Sizes

The Avatar size can be increased by modifying the size property. Each Avatar variant has a default size across all four densities, equal to the [Size Foundation](/salt/foundations/size) `size-base`; 20px (HD), 28px (MD), 36px (LD), and 44px (TD). The size property acts as a multiplier of the base size.

### Custom Fallback Icon

Avatar renders with an icon defined by UserSolidIcon but an alternative icon can be passed as fallbackIcon.
