### Image

You can pass an image using the `src` property to be used as the avatar image.

A custom image or SVG can also be passed as the child of the component. Note that for images passed as children, you will also need to handle the fallback logic.

### Initials

If a photo is not available, the avatar will fall back to initials or an icon:

- Initials can be used when a photo is unavailable, but profile information is

- Icon can be used when neither a photo nor profile information are available

### Sizes

The avatar size can be increased by modifying the size property. Each avatar variant has a default size across all four densities, equal to the Size Foundation size-base; 20px (HD), 28px (MD), 36px (LD), and 44px (TD). The size property acts as a multiplier of the base size.
