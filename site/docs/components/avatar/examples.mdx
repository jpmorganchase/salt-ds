## Image

You can pass an image as the avatar image using the `src` prop.

You can also pass a custom image or SVG as the child of the component. Note that for images passed as children, you'll also need to handle the fallback logic.

<LivePreview componentName="avatar" exampleName="Initials" >

## Initials

If a photo is not available, the avatar will fall back to initials or an icon:

- You can use initials when a photo is unavailable, but profile information is.

- Use an icon when neither a photo nor profile information is available.

<LivePreview componentName="avatar" exampleName="Sizes" >

## Sizes

You can use the `size` prop to modify the avatar size. Each avatar variant has a default size across all four densities, equal to the [size foundation](/salt/foundations/size) `size-base`: 20px (HD), 28px (MD), 36px (LD), and 44px (TD). The size property acts as a multiplier of the base size.

## Custom fallback icon

`Avatar` renders with an icon defined by `UserSolidIcon`, but you can pass an alternative icon as `fallbackIcon`.
