## Checkbox

A single checkbox can be either selected or deselected.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="Default" />

## Checkbox group: vertical (default)

`CheckboxGroup` allows selection of one or more values from a given set of choices. They can be aligned horizontally or vertically. By default, the group is aligned vertically.

### Best practices

- Do not truncate checkbox text descriptions as this can hide important content relevant to the user’s workflow. Consider shortening or rewording the label if space is limited.
- The checkbox should always be placed left aligned to the text.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="VerticalGroup" />

## Checkbox group: horizontal

By default, a checkbox group is aligned vertically. To align horizontally, set `direction="horizontal"`.

### Best practices

Keep text as clear and concise as possible in the horizontal orientation.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="HorizontalGroup" />

## Wrapping checkbox group

By default, a checkbox group in a horizontal alignment wraps onto the next line as the viewport size changes if they don’t fit within a container.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="WrapGroup" />

## Text wrapping

To configure checkbox groups to maintain a horizontal alignment but allow text wrapping, set the prop `wrap=false`.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="NoWrapGroup" />

## Indeterminate checkbox

When a checkbox option is neither selected nor deselected, it is indeterminate. This is a third, separate state.

A checkbox with the prop `indeterminate={true}` will display an indeterminate icon. The most common use is a nested checkbox group with a hierarchy of selections. When the group contains a mix of selected and unselected children, the parent will show an indeterminate state.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="Indeterminate" />

## Disabled checkbox

A disabled checkbox is not interactive or focusable.

You can disable a checkbox by setting `disabled={true}`.

### Best practices

Use a disabled state for checkboxes that have permissions, dependencies or pre-requisites. For example, a checkbox in a [form](/salt/patterns/forms) may be disabled because the user has not yet completed an earlier section of the form.

If a disabled checkbox's text description contains information that is valuable to the user, consider using a read-only checkbox instead.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Read-only checkbox

A read-only checkbox permits the user to only read or copy the text description, but not edit the text or change the state of the checkbox.

A checkbox with the prop `readOnly={true}` will suppress all functionality along with displaying read-only styling.

**Note:** Screen reader support for read-only checkboxes is limited. You can work around this by adding visual or non-visual labels.

### Best practices

Read-only checkboxes are navigable using keyboard shortcuts. This means that, unlike disabled checkboxes, users can interact with the text description. Use a read-only checkbox instead of a disabled checkbox when the text description contains information that is valuable to the user.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="Readonly" />

## Validation states: error

Indicate an error state by setting the `validationStatus` prop to "error". Use when you want to alert the user to a critical issue related to the checkbox.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="Error" />

## Validation states: warning

Indicate a warning state by setting the `validationStatus` prop to "warning". Use when you want to alert the user to a non-critical issue related to the checkbox.

### Best practices

- When used in a group, use `validationStatus` on the group rather than the individual controls. Any status provided to the group will take precedence over the statuses applied directly to the nested controls.
- Avoid using `validationStatus` when a checkbox is disabled. If provided, disabled functionality and styling will take precedence over any validation status styling.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="Warning" />

## Long text support

Checkbox supports long text descriptions. If text wraps to multiple lines, it aligns to the top of the checkbox.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="LongTextGroup" />

## Form field compatibility

You can wrap checkbox groups in a form field when it’s displayed within a form. This provides functionality built into `FormField` for increased accessibility.

For more information, refer to the [form pattern](/salt/patterns/forms).

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="WithFormField" />

## Descriptions

You can add a description to a checkbox using a `StackLayout` in the `label` prop.

<LivePreview componentName="checkbox" exampleName="WithDescription" />
