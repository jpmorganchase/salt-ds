### Best practices

- If you are using a checkbox without a text description, pass an `aria-label` to the checkbox that describes its purpose.
- On focus, the screen reader should:
  - Identify the checkbox
  - Read out the text
  - Express the state

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Moves focus to the checkbox.
- If tabbing into a checkbox group, moves focus to the first checkbox in the group.
- Press tab to move focus between all available checkbox options.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- Press Space to change the state of the checkbox, select or deselect.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- Move focus to outside of the checkbox component and to the previous element in the tabbing order.
- If focus is inside a checkbox group, moves focus to the previous checkbox option within the tabbing order.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
