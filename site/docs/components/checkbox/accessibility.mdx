## Best practices

- If you're using a checkbox without a text description, pass an `aria-label` to the checkbox that describes its purpose.

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab moves focus to the checkbox.
- If moving focus into a checkbox group, Tab moves focus to the first checkbox in the group.
- If focus is inside a checkbox group, Tab moves focus to the next checkbox in the group.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- Space changes the state of the checkbox, select or deselect.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- This action moves focus to outside of the checkbox component and to the previous element in the tabbing order.
- If focus is inside a checkbox group, this action moves focus to the previous checkbox option within the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
