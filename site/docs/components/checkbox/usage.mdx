### Using the Checkbox component

#### When to use Checkbox

- To present an independent choice that the user can select or deselect.
- To present a list of independent options where the user can select any number of choices.

#### When not to use Checkbox

- When the checkbox displays a mutually exclusive choice between two or more options. Instead, use [Radio Button](../radio-button).
- To display a single option but trigger a state change directly and immediately. Instead, use [Switch](../switch).
