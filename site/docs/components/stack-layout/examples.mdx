### Default

By default, Stack Layout displays items in a single column.

Its items align to the start of the layout, with a `gap` between items of 3, which is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing). The height and width of the layout are driven by the items contained within it.

<LivePreview componentName="stack-layout" exampleName="RowDirection" >

### Row direction

The Stack Layout `direction` prop defines the main axis that items are displayed along. Set `direction` to `row` to display items in a horizontal direction along a single line.

### Layout separators

Stack Layout allows for `separators` to be displayed between items. By default, the separators are centered when `separators={true}` but can be customized to sit on the left or right of items.

The separator will span across the layout component if the `direction` is `column`, or span the height if the `direction` is `row`. The Stack Layout `gap` is applied to both sides of the separator.

### Responsive layout

Stack Layout supports responsive props, so you can define different behaviors based on viewport size (e.g., switching `direction` of a card stack with separators across screen size). You can use the default [Salt breakpoints](/salt/foundations/responsiveness#breakpoints) or pass in your own using `SaltProvider`.

#### What are responsive props?

A responsive prop is a prop that takes either multiple values (one value per breakpoint), or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes. For example, a layout that will responsively change direction from row to column at specific breakpoints or viewport sizes:

```js
direction={{ xs: "column", sm: "column", lg: "row", md: "row ", xl: "row" }}
```

### Layout alignment

Control the position of Stack Layout and its items using the `align` prop.

If there is additional space available around the layout (i.e., above or below the row, or beside the column) use the `align` prop to define how items should be positioned within that space.

### Flex Item position

Use the Flex Item `align` prop to set an alignment for a specific item in the layout. Use the `align` prop to change the item’s position along the cross-axis of the layout (i.e., perpendicular to the `direction`–`row` or `column`).

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="stack-layout" exampleName="FlexItemSize" >

### Flex Item size

The Flex Item `grow` prop enables specific items in the layout to grow and fill any remaining space that is available in the layout:

- By default, `grow` is set to 0 and items will be displayed in their ‘normal’ size.
- If an item is set to `1` it will fill the available space.
- If an item is set to `2` it will fill twice as much space as other items that have `grow` set to `1`.

#### Guidance

- In contrast to the `grow` prop, the `shrink` prop makes a specific item as small as possible within the layout. By default, `shrink` is set to `1`. If an item is set to `2`, that item would attempt to take half as much space.
