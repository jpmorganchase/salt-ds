## Default

By default, `StackLayout` displays items in a single column aligned to the start of the layout.

The items contained within the layout determine its height and width.

<LivePreview componentName="stack-layout" exampleName="Default" />

## Row direction

The `direction` prop defines the main axis to display items along. Set `direction` to `row` to display items in a horizontal direction along a single line.

<LivePreview componentName="stack-layout" exampleName="RowDirection" />

## Layout separators

The component allows for `separators` between items. By default, the separators have a cnetered alignment when `separators={true}` but you can customize them to sit on the left or right of items.

The separator will span across the layout component if the `direction` is `column` or span the height if the `direction` is `row`. The Stack Layout `gap` applies to both sides of the separator.

## Responsive layout

`StackLayout` supports responsive props, so you can define different behaviors based on viewport size (e.g., switching `direction` of a card stack with separators across screen size). You can use the default [Salt breakpoints](/salt/foundations/responsiveness#breakpoints) or pass in your own using [`SaltProvider`](/salt/components/salt-provider/).

### Responsive props

A responsive prop takes either multiple values (one value per breakpoint) or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes. For example, this is a layout that will responsively change direction from row to column at specific breakpoints or viewport sizes:

```js
direction={{ xs: "column", sm: "column", lg: "row", md: "row ", xl: "row" }}
```

<LivePreview componentName="stack-layout" exampleName="ResponsiveLayout" />

## Layout alignment

Control the position of `StackLayout` and its items using the `align` prop.

If there's additional space available around the layout (i.e., above or below the row or beside the column), use the `align` prop to define the position of items within that space.

<LivePreview componentName="stack-layout" exampleName="LayoutAlignment" />

## `FlexItem` position

Use the `FlexItem` `align` prop to set an alignment for a specific item in the layout. Use the `align` prop to change the item’s position along the cross axis of the layout (i.e., perpendicular to the `direction`–`row` or `column`).

<LivePreview componentName="stack-layout" exampleName="FlexItemPosition" />

## `FlexItem` size

The `FlexItem` `grow` prop enables specific items in the layout to grow and fill any remaining space in the layout:

- By default, `grow` is set to `0`, and items will be in their "normal" size.
- If you set an item to `1`, it will fill the available space.
- If you set an item to `2`, it will fill twice as much space as other items where `grow` is `1`.

In contrast to the `grow` prop, the `shrink` prop makes a specific item as small as possible within the layout. By default, `shrink` is `1`. If you set an item to `2`, that item would attempt to take half as much space.

<LivePreview componentName="stack-layout" exampleName="FlexItemSize" />

## Spacing

Stack layout displays items with a gap between items that is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing) controlled by the `gap` property and is by default set to 3.
The spacing properties `padding` and `margin` are set to 0 by default and can be used to control the layout's inner and outer spacing also as multiples of the Salt base unit.
