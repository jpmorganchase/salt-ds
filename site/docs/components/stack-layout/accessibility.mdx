## Best practices

When building a subsection of a page using `StackLayout`, Apply semantic HTML. This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

`StackLayout` supports this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.

```tsx
<StackLayout as="ul">
  <FlexItem as="li">List item</FlexItem>
</StackLayout>
```
