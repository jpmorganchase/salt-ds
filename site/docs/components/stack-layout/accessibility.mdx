When building a sub-section of a page using Stack Layout, it is important to make sure you use semantic HTML, which means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

Stack Layout supports this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `"div"`.

```tsx
<StackLayout as="ul">
  <FlexItem as="li">List item</FlexItem>
</StackLayout>
```
