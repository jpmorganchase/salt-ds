title: Stack layout
data:
  description: "`StackLayout` displays items in horizontal or vertical order on a single line. It builds on the `FlexLayout` component and is best for small-scale layouts where displaying components in a single row or column is necessary. It may benefit from supported visual separators, such as a row of charts or a scrolling side panel comprising multiple sections. For additional control of the size and position of content, use `FlexItem` for each content item inside `StackLayout`."
