title: Stack Layout
data:
  description: Stack Layout displays items in either a horizontal or vertical order on a single line. It is built on top of the Flex Layout component and is specifically intended for small-scale layouts where components need to be displayed in a single row or column, and may benefit from the supported visual separators, for example, a row of charts or a scrolling side panel comprising of multiple sections. For additional control of the size and position of content, use Flex Item for each content item inside Stack Layout.

  # Fill in the info from the content template's "Metadata" table below.
  # To omit optional items, comment them out with #
