### When to use Stack Layout

- When you need a layout that is consistently horizontal or vertical. If there is not enough space in the main-axis, scrolling the content is acceptable.

- For small-scale layouts within the application, such as a stack of cards or charts or a vertical side panel with visually distinct sections.

- To change the layoutâ€™s direction depending on breakpoints, and if visual separation using the Stack Layout separators is desirable.

### When not to use Stack Layout

- Stack Layout will never wrap. If you want to create a layout in a row that responsively wraps over multiple lines, use [Flow Layout](/salt/components/flow-layout) instead.

- You want the layout to have more complex customization. In this case we recommend you having a look at [Flex Layout](/salt/components/flex-layout).

### Import

To import Stack Layout from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { StackLayout } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="StackLayout" />
