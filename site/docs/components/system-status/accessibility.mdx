By default, the `SystemStatus` component has the role `"status"`. This means a screen reader will announce the message at the next available opportunity.

## Best practices

- If the status is critical and requires immediate attention, apply `role="alert"` to ensure the message is announced immediately.
- If the status is not critical, consider applying `role="region"`.
