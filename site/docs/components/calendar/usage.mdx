### When to use

Use the `Calendar` component when you need a versatile date selection tool that supports single, range, multiselect, or offset dates. This flexibility makes it ideal for financial applications, event scheduling, project timelines, and other scenarios where different date selection modes are necessary.

### When not to use

- For tasks other than selecting a date, such as picking a time or displaying event information.
- If the date or range is pre-determined and cannot be specified by the user. In such cases, consider showing date options in a dropdown instead.
