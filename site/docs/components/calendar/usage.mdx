## Using the component

## Compose a standard Calendar

To use the `Calendar` component, compose it with the provided children.

- `CalendarNavigation` - provides year/month dropdowns and forward/back controls for the visible month.
- `CalendarWeekHeader` - provides a header for `CalendarGrid` indicating the day of the week.
- `CalendarGrid` - provides a grid of buttons that represent the days from a calendar month.

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="Single" />

## Compose a custom Calendar

Alternatively, you can compose it with your own calendar controls or add additional content.

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="TodayButton" />

### When to use

Use the `Calendar` component when you need a versatile date selection tool that supports single, range, multiselect, or offset dates. This flexibility makes it ideal for financial applications, event scheduling, project timelines, and other scenarios where different date selection modes are necessary.

### When not to use

- For tasks other than selecting a date, such as picking a time or displaying event information.
- If the date or range is pre-determined and cannot be specified by the user. In such cases, consider showing date options in a dropdown instead.

### Setting the date

Date controls, require your application to contain a [LocalizationProvider](../LocalizationProvider).

Pass a date object from your configured date framework via the `defaultDate` or `date` props.

```tsx
import { DateTime } from "luxon";
import { AdapterLuxon } from "@salt-ds/date-adapters/luxon";
import { LocalizationProvider, DateInputSingle, DateInputRange } from "@salt-ds/lab";

<LocalizationProvider DateAdapter={AdapterLuxon}>
    <Calendar
      selectionVariant={"single"}
      defaultSelectedDate={new DateTime().now()}
    >
      <CalendarNavigation />
      <CalendarGrid />
    </Calendar>
<LocalizationProvider>
```

### Locale

The default locale for Salt's date adapters is "enUS".

`Calendar` uses the locale of the configured date adapter provided by the nearest [LocalizationProvider](../LocalizationProvider).
Configuration of locales is date framework specific and may require you to import specific locales from the date library you are using.

Refer to the documentation of the date library you are using for information on how to configure other locales.

### Timezone

`Calendar` accepts a `timezone` prop that defines the timezone.

The default timezone for Salt's components is "default".

Valid values for `timezone` are date framework specific and can be one of the following:

- "default" uses the local timezone of the user's browser.
- "system" uses the timezone of the system running the code.
- "UTC" uses the UTC timezone.
- string uses a specific IANA timezone string, such as "America/New_York" or "Europe/London".
