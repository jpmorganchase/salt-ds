<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="Single">

## Single date selection

When the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "single", the `Calendar` component allows users to select only a single date, providing a straightforward and focused date selection experience.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="Range">

## Date range selection

When the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "range", the `Calendar` component allows users to select a date range, including both a start date and an end date, enabling a comprehensive date selection experience.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="Multiselect">

## Multi-select

When the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "multiselect", the `Calendar` component allows users to select multiple individual dates, providing flexibility for selecting non-consecutive dates.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="Offset">

## Offset selection

When the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "offset", the `Calendar` component allows users to select a date range by choosing a single start date, with the end date automatically determined based on a predefined offset.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="UnselectableDates">

## Unselectable dates

Unselectable dates are visually distinct from selectable dates. When a user attempts to select an unselectable date, the calendar displays a tooltip with additional information. To implement this, use the `isDayUnselectable` prop to pass a function that determines whether a day is unselectable and provides the tooltip description.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="DisabledDates">

## Disabled dates

Disabled dates are not selectable. To implement this, use the `isDayUnselectable` prop to pass a function that determines whether a day is unselectable and provides the tooltip description.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="HighlightedDates">

## Highlighted dates

Highlighted dates are marked by a triangle in the top right corner, indicating an event associated with that day. When a user hovers over a highlighted date, the calendar displays a tooltip with additional information. To implement this, use the `isDayHighlighted` prop to pass a function that determines whether a day is highlighted and provides the tooltip description.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="CustomDayRender">

## Custom day rendering

To customize the rendering of a day element, use the `renderDayContents` prop with the `Calendar` component. This prop accepts a function that is passed a `DateValue` and returns the custom element for that day. This can be useful for scenarios where you need to display additional information or apply custom styling to specific dates.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="HideOutOfRangeDates">

## Hide out-of-range dates

By default, dates outside the visible month are out-of-range and visually distinct from the current month's dates. To hide these out-of-range dates, use the `hideOutOfRangeDates` prop.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="HideYearDropdown">

## Hide year dropdown

To hide the year dropdown, use the `hideYearDropdown` prop with the `CalendarNavigation` component. This can be useful in scenarios such as when the calendar is composed with other calendars or when the date selection does not require a year.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="MinMaxDate">

## Constrained date selection

To constrain the selected date within a specific range, use the `minDate` and/or `maxDate` props. If `minDate` is not provided, it defaults to the year 1900. If `maxDate` is undefined, it defaults to the year 2100. This ensures that the selected date remains within the specified range.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="Bordered">

## Bordered calendar

A `Calendar` component with a border provides a visually distinct area for selecting dates, enhancing the user interface by clearly delineating the calendar boundaries. This styling can improve usability and accessibility by making the calendar controls more noticeable and easier to interact with.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="TwinCalendars">

## Twin calendars

The Twin Calendars example demonstrates how to use the `Calendar` component with the `minDate` and `maxDate` props to create an effective date range picker. By configuring two `Calendar` components side by side, users can easily select a start date and an end date within a specified range.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="WithLocale">

## Locale

When the `locale` prop is provided, the `Calendar` component uses it to define the calendar's locale, ensuring that date formats, month names, and other locale-specific elements are displayed according to the specified locale.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="calendar" exampleName="TodayButton">

## With today button

When the `children` prop is used, the `Calendar` component allows consumers to customize the calendar header, typically by composing it with the `CalendarNavigation` component for forward/back month controls and month/year dropdowns, but it can also be used to add additional controls such as a 'Today' button.
