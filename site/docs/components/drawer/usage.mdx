## Using the component

Drawers cover the entire height of the viewport and are always modal. This means that the content behind them is inert and can't be interacted with. A [`Scrim`](../scrim) is used to visually obscure the content behind the drawer.

Always set a logical width suitable for the content inside the drawer. Refer to Salt's [Forms](/salt/patterns/forms) pattern for information on logical forms width, and the [typography foundation](/salt/foundations/typography) for guidance on paragraph text width.

### When to use

- To reveal additional functionality or information contextual to on-screen content which the user can close when not required.
- To display additional relevant functionality or information, such as a form or sidebar navigation, in a specific area of the screen.
- To allow the user to show and hide additional relevant content.

### When not to use

- To provide an inlaid drawer that opens in-line with content. Instead, use [`BorderLayout`](../layout/border-layout).
- To provide a docked drawer that's fixed in the application layout and always visible. Instead, use [`Panel`](../panel) with styles to expand and collapse a non-modal surface.
