### Using the component

Use the component by wrapping it around your content and setting the desired position. Provide a mechanism, such as [`Button`](../button), for users to open and close it.

When open, the drawer displays a visual overlay, also known as a scrim, over the underlying content. It also plays relevant animations when opening and closing that can be visually customized via CSS.

Use the `useDrawer` hook to handle interactions with the drawer, such as opening and closing it.

### When to use

- When you need additional content, such as a form or sidebar navigation, to be displayed in a specific area of the screen.

### When not to use

- If you want your content split between pages or tabs. Instead, use [`DeckLayout`](../deck-layout).

### Import

To import `Drawer` and `useDrawer` from the lab Salt package, use:

```js
import { Drawer, useDrawer } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```

### Props

<PropsTable packageName="lab" componentName="Drawer" />
