### Using the Drawer component

Use the Drawer component by wrapping it around your content and setting the desired position. Provide a mechanism, such as a Button, for users to open and close it.

When open, the Drawer displays a visual overlay, also known as a scrim, over the underlying content. It also plays relevant animations when opening and closing that can be visually customized via CSS.

#### When to use Drawer

- Use Drawer when you need additional content, such as a form or sidebar navigation, to be displayed in a specific area of the screen.

#### When not to use Drawer

- If you want your content split between pages or tabs, consider [Deck Layout](../deck-layout) instead.
