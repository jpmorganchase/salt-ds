## Default

By default, a drawer anchors to the `left` edge of the screen and has `variant="primary"`.

You can place drawer on the `left`, `right`, `top` and `bottom` edges using the `position` prop.

Set `variant="secondary"` for a secondary drawer.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="Default" />

## Right drawer usage example

Consider using a right-anchored drawer to show supporting information related to the current context, such as recent events, notifications or quick settings. Always set your drawer's width suitable for the content inside it.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="RightDrawer" />

## Top drawer usage example

Anchor your drawer to the top edge if it will display supporting information thatâ€™s related to the current context and is best presented in a horizontal format, e.g., complex filters or a summary panel.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="TopDrawer" />

## Bottom drawer usage example

Anchor a drawer to the bottom edge of the screen when using a master-detail layout with content, such as graphs, images or comparisons that requires a wider horizontal format.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="BottomDrawer" />

## MandatoryAction

This example uses the `disableDismiss` prop to prevent the drawer closing on click away therefore ensuring the user takes an action within the drawer for it to close. This example closes when the user clicks the **Submit** button.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="MandatoryAction" />

## DisableScrim

Use the `disableScrim` prop to prevent the scrim from rendering.

<LivePreview componentName="drawer" exampleName="DisableScrim" />
