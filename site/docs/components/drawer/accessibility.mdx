### Best practices

You can customize or disable the animations using the `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS media feature.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- Activates the trigger/disclosure button if it is in focus, controlling the visibility of the Drawer.
- In closed state: The trigger is a user-defined content element. Drawer opens and focus is set to first focusable element in the Drawer.
- In open state: The trigger is the Drawer's 'X' button. Drawer closes and focus returns to content element trigger.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Moves focus on to the next focusable element in the Drawer. When focus is on the last element in the Drawer, it moves focus to first focusable element in the Drawer.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- Moves focus to the previous focusable element in the Drawer. When focus is on the first element in a Drawer, it moves focus to last focusable element in the Drawer.

</KeyboardControl>
