## Best Practice

Ideally we shouln't use readOnly 

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is on the previous element in the tab order, Tab moves focus to the switch.
- If focus is on switch, Tab moves focus to the next focusable element in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- Space activates switch to change between checked and unchecked state.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is on the switch, this action moves focus out of the component and sets the focus to the previous component in the tab order.
- If focus is below the switch, this action moves focus to the switch.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
