### Best practices

- On focus, the screen reader should:
  - Identify the switch
  - Read out the text
  - Express the state

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is on the previous element in the tab order, move focus onto Switch.
- If focus is on Switch, moves focus to the next focusable element in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- Activate Switch to change state.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is on Switch, moves focus out of the component. Focus is set to the previous component in the tab order.
- If focus is below Switch, move focus to Switch.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
