## Switch

By default, the switch thumb sits to the left side of the track and is in an unchecked state.

- You can set the switch state using the optional `defaultChecked` prop.
- You can use the `onChange` event to read the value using the second parameter.

### Best practices

- Only use the `checked` prop for a controlled switch that requires some logic for validating value.
- We recommend that you always use a text description for a switch.

## Checked

When `defaultChecked={true}`, switch is in a `checked` state, and the switch thumb sits to the right side of the track.

<LivePreview componentName="switch" exampleName="DefaultChecked" />

## Disabled

You can set a switch to a disabled state. When `disabled`, it's not interactive or focusable.

### Best practices

Use a disabled state for switches that have permissions, dependencies or prerequisites. For example, you can disable a switch in a [form](/salt/patterns/forms) because the user hasn't yet completed an earlier section of the form.

<LivePreview componentName="switch" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Disabled checked

You can set a `checked` switch to a disabled state. When `disabled`, it's not interactive or focusable. This shows an option has been “checked” but the user cannot change it.

### Best practices

Use a disabled checked state for switches that have permissions, dependencies or pre-requisites. For example, a switch in a [form](/salt/patterns/forms) may be in a checked state but disabled as the user doesn't have permissions to edit their selection during a later stage in a form.

<LivePreview componentName="switch" exampleName="DisabledChecked" />

## Read-only

A read-only switch allows the user to focus the control, but doesn't allow them to change its state. You can set a switch as read-only via the prop `readOnly`.

**Note:** We recommend avoiding read-only switches due to the lack of adequate `aria-readonly` support and conflicting user expectations. If you must use a read-only switch, you should always add an accessible name that makes it obvious the switch is read-only, be that via a visual label or an `aria-label` if there's no space for a visual label.

### Best practices

Read-only switches are navigable using keyboard shortcuts. This means that, unlike disabled switches, users can interact with the text description. Use a read-only switch instead of a disabled switch when the text description contains information that is valuable to the user.

<LivePreview componentName="switch" exampleName="Readonly" />

## Left aligned label

Use a form field if you need a left aligned label, avoid also having a switch label.

<LivePreview componentName="switch" exampleName="LeftAlignedLabel" />
