### Switch

By default, the switch thumb sits to the left side of the track and is in an unchecked state.

- The switch state can be set using the optional `defaultChecked` prop.
- The `onChange` event can be used to read the value using the second parameter.

Guidance:

- Only use the `checked` prop for a controlled switch that requires some logic for validating value.
- We recommend that you always use a text description for a switch.

### Checked

When ` defaultChecked=”true”`, switch is in a `checked` state and the switch thumb sits to the right side of the track.

<LivePreview componentName="switch" exampleName="Disabled" >

### Disabled

You can set Switch to a disabled state. When `disabled`, it is not interactive or focusable.

Guidance:

Use a disabled state for switches that have permissions, dependencies or pre-requisites. For example, a switch in a [Form](/salt/patterns/forms) may be disabled because the user has not yet completed an earlier section of the form.

### Disabled checked

You can set a `checked` switch to a disabled state. When `disabled`, it is not interactive or focusable. This shows an option has been toggled to be “checked” but cannot be changed.

Guidance:

Use a disabled checked state for switches that have permissions, dependencies or pre-requisites. For example, a switch in a [Form](/salt/patterns/forms) may be checked but disabled as the user does not have permissions to edit their selection during a later stage in a form.
