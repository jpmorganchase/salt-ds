### Switch

By default, the switch thumb sits to the left side of the track and is in an unchecked state.

- You can set the switch state using the optional `defaultChecked` prop.
- You can use the `onChange` event to read the value using the second parameter.

#### Best practices

- Only use the `checked` prop for a controlled switch that requires some logic for validating value.
- We recommend that you always use a text description for a switch.

### Checked

When `defaultChecked={true}`, switch is in a `checked` state, and the switch thumb sits to the right side of the track.

<LivePreview componentName="switch" exampleName="Disabled" >

### Disabled

You can set a switch to a disabled state. When `disabled`, it's not interactive or focusable.

#### Best practices

Use a disabled state for switches that have permissions, dependencies or prerequisites. For example, you can disable a switch in a [form](/salt/patterns/forms) because the user hasn't yet completed an earlier section of the form.

### Disabled checked

You can set a `checked` switch to a disabled state. When `disabled`, it's not interactive or focusable. This shows an option has been “checked” but the user cannot change it.

#### Best practices

Use a disabled checked state for switches that have permissions, dependencies or pre-requisites. For example, a switch in a [form](/salt/patterns/forms) may be in a checked state but disabled as the user doesn't have permissions to edit their selection during a later stage in a form.
