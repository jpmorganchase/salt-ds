## Using the component

### When to use

- To present an instantaneous, binary choice between two options that doesn’t require the user to submit or confirm the action. The corresponding action takes effect immediately.
- To control a critical action that may require confirmation from the user before applying it. This delay is usually intentional, ensuring that users don't accidentally make unwanted changes.

### When not to use

- To present a list of independent options where the user can select any number of choices. Instead, use [`Checkbox`](../checkbox).
- To make a single selection between mutually exclusive choices between two or more options. Instead, use [`RadioButton`](../radio-button).
- To toggle between two (or more) opposing yet mutually exclusive states or options with visual priority. Instead, use [`ToggleButton`](../toggle-button).
- To present multiple options in a group within a compact UI, or if they’re subject to change depending on context. Instead, use selectable [`Pill`](../pill).

## Content

- Clarify the option that the switch controls in the text inline to the switch.
- Text should always sit to the right of the switch.
- Keep the text description as clear and concise as possible, and ensure it accurately describes the action the switch will perform upon interaction.
