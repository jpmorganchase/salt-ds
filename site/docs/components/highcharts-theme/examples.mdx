## Line Chart

Use a line chart to show changes in data over time. To ensure accessible presentation, line patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="LineChart" />

## Donut Chart

Use a donut chart to show proportions of a whole. To ensure accessible presentation, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="DonutChart" />
