<Callout title="Note">
  This package is a WIP. Highcharts CSS files and Options object are not finalized. Only charts with provided examples are supported.

Current issues to be resolved before lab release:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Legend positioning isn't consistent with Figma examples due to Highcharts API limitations - [track issue](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/salt-ds/issues/5548).
    </li>
    <li>
      Plot bands aren't currently supported due to v10 accessibility and token issues. If you need to use plot bands, you need to ensure that appropriate color contrast is maintained - [track issue](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/salt-ds/issues/5548 )
    </li>
  </ul>

## Line chart

Use a line chart to show changes in data over time. To ensure accessible presentation, line patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="LineChart" />

## Pie chart

Use a pie chart to show proportions of a whole. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="PieChart" />

## Donut chart

Use a donut chart to show proportions of a whole, with space in the center to highlight key values or additional information. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

A donut chart is a variation of the pie chart, with the `plotOptions.pie.innerSize` set to less than `100%` within the `Options` object.

### Best practices

- An `innerSize` value of `80%` is recommended for a good default visual balance.

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="DonutChart" />

## Column chart

Use a column chart to compare values across categories. Each category is represented by a single vertical bar. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="ColumnChart" />

## Bar chart

Use a bar chart to compare values across categories. Bars are shown side-by-side for each series. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="BarChart" />

## Stacked bar chart

Use a stacked bar chart to compare part-to-whole relationships across categories. Each bar shows the total, with segments representing series values. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

A stacked bar chart is a variation of the bar chart, with the `plotOptions.series.stacking` set to `normal` within the `Options` object.

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="StackedBarChart" />

## Bullet chart

Use a bullet chart to show performance against a target across categories. Each category displays a single bar with a marker indicating the target value. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<Callout title="Note">
  To use the bullet chart, ensure you import the Highcharts `bullet` module and
  use it to wrap the `Highcharts` object as shown in the example below.
</Callout>

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="BulletChart" />

## Area chart

Use an area chart to show trends over time and the contribution of categories to a total. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="AreaChart" />

## Scatter chart

Use a scatter chart to show the relationship between two numerical variables. To ensure accessible presentation, fill patterns can be applied to the scatter points (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

The `axes-grid-lines` class name applied to the container enables both vertical and horizontal grid lines.

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="ScatterChart" />

## Bubble chart

Use a bubble chart to show the relationship between two variables, with a third variable represented by the size of each bubble. This is helpful for visualizing clusters and outliers across categories. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

The `axes-grid-lines` class name applied to the container enables both vertical and horizontal grid lines.

<Callout title="Note">
  To use the bubble chart, import the Highcharts `highcharts-more` module and
  use it to wrap the `Highcharts` object as shown in the example.
