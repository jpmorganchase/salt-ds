<Callout title="Note">
  This package is a WIP. Highcharts CSS files and Options object are not finalized. Only charts with provided examples are supported.

Current issues to be resolved before lab release:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Legend positioning is not consistent with Figma examples due to Highcharts API limitations - [track issue](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/salt-ds/issues/5555).
    </li>
  </ul>

## Line chart

Use a line chart to show changes in data over time. To ensure accessible presentation, line patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="LineChart" />

## Pie chart

Use a pie chart to show proportions of a whole. To ensure accessible presentation, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="PieChart" />

## Donut chart

Use a donut chart to show proportions of a whole, with space in the center to highlight key values or additional information. To ensure accessible presentation, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

A donut chart is a variation of the pie chart, with the `plotOptions.pie.innerSize` set to less than `100%` within the `Options` object.

### Best practices

- An `innerSize` value of `80%` is recommended for a good default visual balance.

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="DonutChart" />

## Stacked bar chart

Use a stacked bar chart to compare part-to-whole relationships across categories. Each bar shows the total, with segments representing series values. To ensure accessible presentation, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

A stacked bar chart is a variation of the bar chart, with the `plotOptions.series.stacking` set to `normal` within the `Options` object.

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="StackedBarChart" />
