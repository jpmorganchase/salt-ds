  This package is a WIP. Highcharts CSS files and Options object are not
  finalized. Only charts with provided examples are supported.

## Line Chart

Use a line chart to show changes in data over time. To ensure accessible presentation, line patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="LineChart" />

## Pie Chart

Use a pie chart to show proportions of a whole. To ensure accessible presentation, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

<LivePreview componentName="highcharts-theme" exampleName="PieChart" />

## Donut Chart

Use a donut chart to show proportions of a whole, with space in the center to highlight key values or additional information. To ensure accessible presentation, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

A donut chart is a variation of the pie chart, with the `plotOptions.pie.innerSize` set to less than `100%` within the `Options` object.

### Best practices

- An `innerSize` value of `80%` is recommended for a good default visual balance.
