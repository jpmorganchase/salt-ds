## Using the package

## Import

To install the Salt Highcharts theme package, ensure you have a supported version of Highcharts installed and add `@salt-ds/highcharts-theme` via your package manager

```bash
npm install @salt-ds/highcharts-theme
# or
yarn add @salt-ds/highcharts-theme
```

### Import Highcharts CSS

The Salt Highcharts theme overrides the default Highcharts CSS. To ensure the theme is applied correctly, import the Highcharts CSS before the Salt Highcharts theme CSS.

<Callout title="Note">
  You can download the [Highcharts CSS
  here](https://code.highcharts.com/10.2.0/css/highcharts.css), specifying the
  required version via the URL.
</Callout>

### Import Salt Highcharts theme

To import the Salt Highcharts theme, use:

```js
import "@salt-ds/highcharts-theme/index.css";
```

Then wrap your Highcharts with `highcharts-theme-salt` class name as shown below:

```jsx
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={yourChartSpecificOptions} />
</div>
```

### Set Highcharts Global options

Many Highchart stylistic properties are inconfigurable via CSS alone. To adhere to the Salt design system, import and set the [Highcharts global options](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options) at your entry point.

```js
import Highcharts from "highcharts";

Highcharts.setOptions(highchartsOptionsSalt);
```

<Callout title="Note">

If you already have a global options object, you can call `Highcharts.setOptions` again with the `highchartsOptionsSalt` after your initial call. Any fields set by `highchartsOptionsSalt` will take precedence over any previously set fields.

For granular control, you can also use the `Highcharts.merge()` utility function to deep merge the `highchartsOptionsSalt` with your existing options object, including at the chart level.

</Callout>

### Patterns and Fills

The Salt Highcharts theme also provides Salt patterns and fills that can be applied to create visible contrast between series. 

For example, the `salt-line-patterns` class applies
a line pattern to each series in a Line Chart. See the [Examples](./examples) section to see how to apply fills and patterns in specific charts.

Guidance on Fills TBA.
