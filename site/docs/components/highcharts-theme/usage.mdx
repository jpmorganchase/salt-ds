## Import

### Set Highcharts Global options

To get started with the Salt Highcharts Theme, import and set the [Highcharts global options](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options) at your entry point. This ensures that Highchart runs in `styledMode` and allows for the use of CSS classes to style the chart
along with the setting of positional properties like spacing and dimensions.

```js
import Highcharts from "highcharts";

Highcharts.setOptions(saltHCThemeOptions);
```

<Callout title="Note">

If you already have a global options object, you can call `Highcharts.setOptions` with your existing options object and then again using the `saltHCThemeOptions` object to set the Salt theme. Note that the order of `setOptions` calls matter - the last call will override the previous ones.

### Import Salt Highcharts theme

To import the Salt Highcharts theme, use:

```js
import "@salt-ds/highcharts-theme/index.css";
```

Then wrap your Highcharts with `salt-highcharts-theme` class names shown below:

```js
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={options1} />
</div>
```
