## Using the package

### When to use

When you want to use the Salt theme with Highcharts version 10.

## Import

To install the theme package, ensure you have a supported version of Highcharts installed and add `@salt-ds/highcharts-theme` via your package manager

```bash
npm install @salt-ds/highcharts-theme
# or
yarn add @salt-ds/highcharts-theme

```

### Set Highcharts Global options

To get started with the Salt Highcharts Theme, import and set the [Highcharts global options](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options) at your entry point. This ensures that Highchart runs in `styledMode` and allows for the use of CSS classes to style the chart
along with the setting of positional properties like spacing and dimensions.

```js
import Highcharts from "highcharts";

Highcharts.setOptions(saltHCThemeOptions);
```

<Callout title="Note">

If you already have a global options object, you can call `Highcharts.setOptions` again with the `saltHCThemeOptions` after your initial call. Any fields set by `saltHCThemeOptions` will take precedence over any previously set fields.

For granular control, you can also use the `Highcharts.merge()` utility function to deep merge the `saltHCThemeOptions` with your existing options object, including at the chart level.

</Callout>

### Import Salt Highcharts theme

To import the Salt Highcharts theme, use:

```js
import "@salt-ds/highcharts-theme/index.css";
```

Then wrap your Highcharts with `salt-highcharts-theme` class names shown below:

```js
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={yourChartSpecificOptions} />
</div>
```
