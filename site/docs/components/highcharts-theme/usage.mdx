## Using the package

## Import

To install the Salt Highcharts theme package, ensure you have a supported version of Highcharts installed and add `@salt-ds/highcharts-theme` via your package manager

```bash
npm install @salt-ds/highcharts-theme
# or
yarn add @salt-ds/highcharts-theme
```

### Import Highcharts CSS

The Salt Highcharts theme overrides the default Highcharts CSS. To ensure the theme is applied correctly, import the Highcharts CSS before the Salt Highcharts theme CSS.

<Callout title="Note">
  You can download the [Highcharts CSS
  here](https://code.highcharts.com/10.2.0/css/highcharts.css), specifying the
  required version via the URL.

For more information on loading Highcharts CSS, [visit the Highcharts docs](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/style-by-css).

### Import Salt Highcharts theme

To import the Salt Highcharts theme, use:

```js
import "@salt-ds/highcharts-theme/index.css";
```

Then wrap your Highcharts with `highcharts-theme-salt` class name as shown below:

```jsx
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={yourChartSpecificOptions} />
</div>
```

### Set Highcharts Global options

Many Highchart stylistic properties can't be configured via CSS alone. To adhere to the Salt design system, import and set the [Highcharts global options](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options) at your entry point.

```js
import Highcharts from "highcharts";
import { highchartsOptionsSalt } from "@salt-ds/highcharts-theme";

Highcharts.setOptions(highchartsOptionsSalt);
```

<Callout title="Note">

If you already have a [Highcharts global options object](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options), you can call `Highcharts.setOptions` again with the `highchartsOptionsSalt` after your initial call. Any fields set by `highchartsOptionsSalt` will take precedence over any previously set fields.

For granular control, you can also use the `Highcharts.merge()` utility function to deep merge the `highchartsOptionsSalt` with your existing options object, including at the chart level.

</Callout>

## Chart Density

Highcharts doesn't automatically respond to changes in CSS custom properties after the initial render.
Use the `useChart` hook from the Salt Highcharts theme to trigger redraws when density changes and provide density‑aware values for your chart options.

The `useChart` hook takes a `chartRef` and reads the current Salt `density` internally, then:

1. Calls `chart.redraw()` whenever the density changes so Highcharts can
   recalculate its layout.
2. Returns an object of density-sensitive values that you can provide
   to your Highcharts `options` object.

Available density-sensitive values:

- `legendIconSize` – pixel size that maps to the current Salt density.
  Use this for `legend.symbolHeight` and `legend.symbolWidth`.

### Example

```jsx
import { useRef, useMemo } from "react";
import Highcharts from "highcharts";
import HighchartsReact from "highcharts-react-official";
import { useChart } from "@salt-ds/highcharts-theme";

export const DensityAwareChart = () => {
  const chartRef = useRef(null);

  // Force a redraw and grab density-aware values (density is read internally)
  const { legendIconSize } = useChart({ chartRef });

  const options = useMemo(
    () => ({
      chart: { type: "pie" },
      legend: {
        symbolHeight: legendIconSize,
        symbolWidth: legendIconSize,
      },
      // …other chart options
    }),
    [legendIconSize],
  );

  return (
    <div className="highcharts-theme-salt">
      <HighchartsReact
        ref={chartRef}
        highcharts={Highcharts}
        options={options}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Patterns and Fills

The Salt Highcharts theme also provides Salt patterns and fills that can be applied to create visible contrast between series. This is particularly valuable for users with accessibility needs.

### Line Patterns

To apply line patterns to charts such as LineChart, apply the `salt-line-patterns` class name to the chart container.

```jsx
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt salt-line-patterns">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={yourChartSpecificOptions} />
</div>
```

### Fill Patterns

To apply fill patterns to charts such as DonutChart, apply the `salt-fill-patterns` class name to the chart container.

```jsx
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt salt-fill-patterns">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={yourChartSpecificOptions} />
</div>
```
