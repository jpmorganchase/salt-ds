## Using the package

## Import

To install the Salt Highcharts theme package, ensure you have a supported version of Highcharts installed and add `@salt-ds/highcharts-theme` via your package manager

```bash
npm install @salt-ds/highcharts-theme
# or
yarn add @salt-ds/highcharts-theme
```

### Import Highcharts CSS

The Salt Highcharts theme overrides the default Highcharts CSS. To ensure the theme is applied correctly, import the Highcharts CSS before the Salt Highcharts theme CSS.

<Callout title="Note">
  You can download the [Highcharts CSS
  here](https://code.highcharts.com/10.2.0/css/highcharts.css), specifying the
  required version via the URL.

For more information on loading Highcharts CSS, [visit the Highcharts docs](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-design-and-style/style-by-css).

### Import Salt Highcharts theme

To import the Salt Highcharts theme, use:

```js
import "@salt-ds/highcharts-theme/index.css";
```

Then wrap your Highcharts with `highcharts-theme-salt` class name as shown below:

```jsx
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={options} />
</div>
```

## useChart hook

Many Highchart stylistic properties can't be configured via CSS alone and are not density sensitive. Wrap your Highcharts options with the `useChart` hook to ensure the theme is applied correctly.

```jsx
import { useChart } from "@salt-ds/highcharts-theme";

const options = useChart(yourChartSpecificOptions);
```

See [examples](./examples) and the [Highcharts options](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/how-to-set-options) documentation for more information.

## Patterns and fills

The Salt Highcharts theme provides patterns and fills that can be applied to create visible contrast between series. This is particularly valuable for users with accessibility needs.

### Line patterns

To apply line patterns to charts such as LineChart, apply the `salt-line-patterns` class name to the chart container.

```jsx
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt salt-line-patterns">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={options} />
</div>
```

### Fill patterns

To apply fill patterns to charts such as DonutChart, apply the `salt-fill-patterns` class name to the chart container.

```jsx
<div className="highcharts-theme-salt salt-fill-patterns">
  <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={options} />
</div>
```
