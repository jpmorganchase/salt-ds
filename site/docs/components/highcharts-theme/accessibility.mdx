## Accessibility module

Highcharts provides an [accessibility module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/accessibility/accessibility-module) that enhances the accessibility of charts.

To enable the accessibility module in Highcharts v10, import and initialize the module as shown below:

```js
import accessibility from "highcharts/modules/accessibility";

accessibility(Highcharts);
```

<Callout title="Note">

From Highcharts v11 onwards, you no longer need to call a function to initialize the accessibility module. Ensure you follow the guidance above for Highcharts v10 compatibility.
