## Accessibility module

Highcharts provides an [accessibility module](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/accessibility/accessibility-module) that enhances the accessibility of charts.

### Highcharts v10

To enable the accessibility module in Highcharts v10, import and initialize the module with your Highcharts instance:

```js
import accessibility from "highcharts/modules/accessibility";

accessibility(Highcharts);
```

### Highcharts v11+

From Highcharts v11+ onwards, the accessibility module auto-initializes upon import:

```js
import "highcharts/modules/accessibility";
```
