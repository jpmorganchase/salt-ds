    <LivePreview componentName="salt-provider" exampleName="Theme" >

## Theme

Use `SaltProvider` to change the theme of your application with the `theme` prop. The default setting is `salt-theme`.

Use the `useTheme` hook to access the currently active theme.

    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="salt-provider" exampleName="Modes" >

## Modes

Use the `mode` prop to change the mode for all nested components. Modes enable the color palette to change from light to dark. You can read more about it on the [modes foundation](/salt/foundations/modes) page. The default mode is `light` mode.

You can use the mode toggle at the top of this page to change the mode in the example. Note how the card background and text change.

Use the `useTheme` hook to access the current mode.

    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="salt-provider" exampleName="Density" >

## Density

Use the `density` prop to change the density for all nested components. Density controls the amount of content that can fit on a screen based on the size and spacing of components. You can read more about it on the [density foundation](/salt/foundations/density) page. The default density is `medium`.

You can use the density toggle at the top of this page to change the density and see how the spacing changes between the squares.

Use the `useDensity` hook to access the current density.

    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="salt-provider" exampleName="Breakpoints" >

## Breakpoints

Use the `breakpoints` prop to customize the CSS media queries that hooks such as `useBreakpoints` and `useCurrentBreakpoint` use internally. You can use these hooks for the responsive props to pass multiple values (one per breakpoint) or a single value that would take affect across all screen sizes. You can read the [responsiveness foundation page](/salt/foundations/responsiveness) for more information about Salt's default breakpoints.

Use the `useBreakpoints` hook to access the current breakpoints defined via the Salt Provider. This is a low-level hook used internally in other hooks.

    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="salt-provider" exampleName="NestedProviders" >

## Nested providers

You can use `SaltProvider` to create scoped themes, allowing you to mix themes, modes, densities and breakpoints in your application. Familiarize yourself with the guidance on our [foundations](/salt/foundations/index) pages, where we recommend that you use this sparingly. Nested providers will inherit values from parent providers.
