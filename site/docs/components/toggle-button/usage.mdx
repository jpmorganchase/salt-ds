### Using the Toggle Button component

#### When to use Toggle Button

- To make a single selection when switching between opposing yet mutually exclusive options.
- To visually prioritize options higher than [Radio Button](../radio-button) or [Switch](../switch).

#### When not to use Toggle Button

- To present an instantaneous or binary choice between two options. Instead, use [Switch](../switch)
- When the options in the group are not high priority and high affordance is not required. Instead, use [Radio Button Group](../radio-button).
- When all options in the group don’t need to be visible at once, consider using [Dropdown](../dropdown).
- To present options in a Toggle Button Group within a compact UI, or they’re subject to change depending on context. Instead, use [Selectable Pill](../pill).

### Import

{/* Update the text and code snippet below as needed: */}

To import Toggle Button and Toggle Button Group from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { ToggleButton, ToggleButtonGroup } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

{/* Update packageName and componentName below as needed */}
{/* packageName is optional and defaults to "core" if omitted */}

#### Toggle Button

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="ToggleButton" />

#### Toggle Button Group

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="ToggleButtonGroup" />

### Content

- Always style button text in all caps for prominence. This also avoids confusion with body text or general writing.
- Never use ampersand (&) in button text to save space.
- Keep the text description short, ideally one to three words and no more than five. If you’re including an icon with the text, use no more than three words.
