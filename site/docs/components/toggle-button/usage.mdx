## Using the components

### When to use

- To make a single selection when switching between opposing yet mutually exclusive options.
- To visually prioritize options higher than [`RadioButton`](../radio-button) or [`Switch`](../switch).

### When not to use

- To present an instantaneous or binary choice between two options. Instead, use [`Switch`](../switch).
- When the options in the group are not high priority and high affordance is not necessary. Instead, use [`RadioButtonGroup`](../radio-button).
- When all options in the group don’t need to be visible at once. Consider using [`Dropdown`](../dropdown).
- To present options in a toggle button group within a compact UI, or if they’re subject to change depending on context. Instead, use [`Pill`](../pill).

## Import

{/* Update the text and code snippet below as needed: */}

To import `ToggleButton` and `ToggleButtonGroup` from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { ToggleButton, ToggleButtonGroup } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

## Props

{/* Update packageName and componentName below as needed */}
{/* packageName is optional and defaults to "core" if omitted */}

### `ToggleButton`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="ToggleButton" />

### `ToggleButtonGroup`

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="ToggleButtonGroup" />

## Content

- Always style button text in all caps for prominence. This also avoids confusion with body text or general writing.
- Never use ampersand (&) in button text to save space.
- Keep the text description short, ideally one to three words and no more than five. If you’re including an icon with the text, use no more than three words.
