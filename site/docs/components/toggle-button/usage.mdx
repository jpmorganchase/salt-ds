## Using the components

### When to use

- To make a single selection when switching between opposing yet mutually exclusive options.
- To visually prioritize options higher than [`RadioButton`](../radio-button) or [`Switch`](../switch).

### When not to use

- To present an instantaneous or binary choice between two options. Instead, use [`Switch`](../switch).
- When the options in the group are not high priority and high affordance is not necessary. Instead, use [`RadioButtonGroup`](../radio-button).
- When all options in the group don’t need to be visible at once. Consider using [`Dropdown`](../dropdown).

## Content

- Never use ampersand (&) in button text to save space.
- Keep the text description short, ideally one to three words and no more than five. If you’re including an icon with the text, use no more than three words.
