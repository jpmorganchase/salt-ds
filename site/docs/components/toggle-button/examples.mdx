### Toggle Button

The basic toggle button component allows users to switch between two states.

Use icons and text in toggle buttons if it's important to visually reinforce the theme of the options. Or if providing additional context may help decision-making (for example, selecting a document type or a text style).

Pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to the icon so its text description is not announced by the screen reader.

Guidance:

- To reduce visual noise and mitigate alignment issues, use icons in toggle button labels consistently across all options in a toggle button group.
- Icons are placed to the left of the text only to describe the button.

### Toggle Button Group

Toggle Button Group allows users to make a mutually exclusive selection from a set of related commands—with only one option selected at a time.

Guidance:

- A toggle button group should always contain two or more options related by function or context. Examples include text alignment (left, center, right) or speed selection (slow, medium, fast).
- Use text description in addition to or instead of an icon if the options in the toggle button group are high priority. Users will be less likely to overlook the options.

### Icon only

Toggle buttons can be used with icons only.

Guidance:

- An icon only toggle button should be self-explanatory, ideally using well known symbols. If the purpose of the button isn’t clear from the icon along, add a label.
- An accessible label should be provided for each toggle button.
- A [Tooltip](../tooltip) should be used to provide additional context for each toggle button.

### Text only

You can configure toggle buttons to display text only if you can’t identify a suitable or intuitive icon.

### Disabled

Toggle buttons can be disabled if required by context or user permissions. Disabling a toggle button will suppress all functionality.

### Toggle Button Group Orientation

By default, a toggle button group is aligned horizontally. If the options are better presented in a stacked layout, orientate the group vertically using the `orientation=”vertical”` prop.
