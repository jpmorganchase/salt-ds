## Toggle button

The basic `ToggleButton` allows users to switch between two states.

Use icons and text in toggle buttons if it's important to visually reinforce the theme of the options or if providing additional context may help decision making (for example, selecting a document type or a text style).

Pass `aria-hidden={true}` to the icon so the screen reader doesn't announce its text description.

### Best practices

- To reduce visual noise and mitigate alignment issues, use icons in toggle button labels consistently across all options in a toggle button group.
- Icons are placed to the left of the text only to describe the button.

## Icon only

You can use toggle buttons with icons only.

### Best practices

- An icon-only toggle button should be self-explanatory, ideally using well-known symbols. If the purpose of the button isn’t clear from the icon alone, add a label.
- Provide an accessible label for each toggle button.
- Use [`Tooltip`](../tooltip) to provide additional context for each toggle button.

## Text only

You can configure toggle buttons to only display text if you can’t identify a suitable or intuitive icon.

<LivePreview componentName="toggle-button" exampleName="TextOnly" />

## Sentiment

Toggle button has four other sentiments available — `accented`, `positive`, `caution` and `negative`. You can set this using the `sentiment` prop. Sentiments are based on the following recommendations:

- **Accented**: Allows greater visual emphasis to be placed on actions.
- **Positive**: Indicates actions that result in positive outcomes.
- **Caution**: Alerts users to potential consequences that may arise from taking an action.
- **Negative**: Indicates actions that lead to negative outcomes.

## Selected appearance

Toggle buttons offer two visual styles to indicate a selected state: `solid` and `bordered`. You can set this using the `appearance` prop.

## Read-only

A read-only toggle button permits the user to only read the toggle button's content, but not edit the state of the toggle button.

A toggle button with the prop `readOnly={true}` will suppress all functionality along with displaying read-only styling.

**Note**: Screen reader support for read-only toggle buttons is limited. You can work around this by adding visual or non-visual labels.

### Best practices

Read-only toggle buttons are navigable using keyboard shortcuts. This means that, unlike disabled toggle buttons, users can focus the read-only toggle buttons. Use a read-only toggle button instead of a disabled toggle button when the state and content of the toggle button contains information that is valuable to the user.

## Disabled

Toggle buttons can be disabled based on context or user permissions. When a toggle button is disabled, all functionality is suppressed.

<LivePreview componentName="toggle-button" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Toggle button group

`ToggleButtonGroup` allows users to make a mutually exclusive selection from a set of related commands—with only one option selected at a time.

### Best practices

- A toggle button group should always contain two or more options related by function or context. Examples include text alignment (left, center, right) or speed selection (slow, medium, fast).
- Use text description in addition to or instead of an icon if the options in the toggle button group are high priority. Users will be less likely to overlook the options.

## Toggle button group orientation

By default, a toggle button group has horizontal alignment. If you can present the options in a stacked layout, orientate the group vertically using the `orientation=”vertical”` prop.

  exampleName="ToggleButtonGroupVertical"
/>

## Toggle button group read-only

Setting the toggle button group as read-only using the `readOnly` prop will render the toggle button group in a non-interactive state and with read-only styles. This is useful for scenarios where users need to view the current selection without making changes.

If a toggle button is in a selected state within a read-only toggle button group, it will retain its visual style to indicate selection and remain focusable via keyboard navigation, ensuring that users can perceive the selection through assistive technologies.

## Toggle button group disabled

Disabling a toggle button group using the `disabled` prop will suppress functionality for all buttons within it.

## Toggle button group sentiments

Sentiment can be set to a toggle button group or individual buttons within a group, allowing for mixed sentiments via the `sentiment` prop.

<LivePreview
  componentName="toggle-button"
  exampleName="ToggleButtonGroupSentiment"
/>

## Toggle button selected appearance

The `appearance` prop allows you to define the selected appearance for all buttons in the toggle button group as either `solid` or `bordered`.
