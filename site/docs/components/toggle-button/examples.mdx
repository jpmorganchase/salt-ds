## Toggle button group

A `ToggleButtonGroup` allows users to make a single selection from a set of related commands, with only one option selected at a time.

### Best practices

- To reduce visual noise and mitigate alignment issues, use icons in toggle button labels consistently across all options in a toggle button group.
- A toggle button group should always contain two or more options related by function or context. For example, text alignment (left, center, right, justified) or risk level (high, medium, low).

## Group orientation

By default, a toggle button group has horizontal alignment. To present the options in a stacked layout, orientate the group vertically using the `orientation=”vertical”` prop.

When oriented vertically, the group will resize to fit the longest toggle button, with all other buttons in the group extending to fill the same width.

## Read-only group

Setting the toggle button group as read-only using the `readOnly` prop will render the toggle button group in a non-interactive state and with read-only styles. This is useful for scenarios where users need to view the current selection, but may not have the right permissions to change it.

If a toggle button is in a selected state within a read-only toggle button group, it will retain its visual style to indicate selection and remain focusable via keyboard navigation, ensuring that users can perceive the selection through assistive technologies.

## Disabled group

Disabling a toggle button group using the `disabled` prop will suppress functionality for all buttons within it.

**Disable or Read-Only**: Disable the group when it isn't relevant or permitted in the current user flow. In this state, it won't be focusable for screen readers. Set the group to read-only when it's important for the user to know which option is currently selected. When set to read-only, the selected button will still be focusable for screen readers but will be indicated as non-interactive.

## Group sentiments

Sentiment can be set on a toggle button group or individual buttons within a group. Setting sentiment on individual buttons allows for a mixed group.

Set sentiment by using the `sentiment` prop, either on the group or on individual toggle buttons within the group.

## Appearance

The `appearance` prop allows you to define the appearance for all buttons in the toggle button group.

### Best practices

- **Set Appearance on the Group**: Although it's possible to mix sentiment within a group, it isn't recommended to do the same with appearance as it can lead to visual inconsistency and diminish clarity for the user.

## Controlled group

You can manage the state of the toggle button group externally using the `value` and `onChange` props. This approach provides greater control over the component's behavior and enables synchronization with other parts of your application.

## Standalone toggle button

Standalone toggle buttons should be used sparingly, as other selection controls are often preferred. They are best for switching between two distinct states (i.e, yes/no, on/off, show/hid). Consider alternative controls to enhance user experience based on the context.

### Alternative controls

- [`Switch`](/salt/components/switch): Provides a clear visual indication of the current state and is commonly used to turn features on or off.
- [`RadioButtonGroup`](/salt/components/radio-button): Preferred for boolean selections in forms or data input, especially when additional choices like "yes", "no" or "not applicable" are needed.
- [`Dropdown`](/salt/components/dropdown): Ideal for boolean options when space is limited, favoring clear text labels over a simple switch.

### Best practices

- Switching icon variants or entire icons based on the selection state of the toggle button can help communicate the current state of the button.
- Follow [`Button`](/salt/components/button)'s best practices for accessibility and interaction.
