### Best practices

- On focus, the screen reader should:
  - Identify the toggle button
  - Read out the text
  - Expresses the state
  - Read the position of the option within the total number of buttons available

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Moves focus into the toggle button group. Focus is set to the active button.
- If focus is inside the toggle button group, moves focus out of the toggle button group. Focus is set to the next component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space / Enter">

- When focus is on the toggle button and the button is inactive, it activates the button.
- If focus is on an active button, the button remains active.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is inside the toggle button group, moves focus out of the component. Focus is set to the previous component in the tab order.
- If focus is below the toggle button group, move focus into the toggle button group. Focus is set to the active button.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="ArrowRight / ArrowDown">

- Moves focus to the next toggle button in the toggle button group.
- If focus is on the last toggle button, wrap focus to the first toggle button.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="ArrowLeft / ArrowUp">

- Moves focus to the previous toggle button in the toggle button group.
- If focus is on the first toggle button, wrap focus to the last toggle button.
