## Best practices

- When a toggle button has both an icon and text, use `aria-hidden` on the icon so that screen readers don't announce its text.
- When a toggle button has an icon only and no text, pass an `aria-label` to the button that describes its purpose.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab moves focus into the toggle button group. Focus is set to the active button.
- If focus is inside the toggle button group, Tab moves focus out of the toggle button group. Focus is set to the next component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space / Enter">

- When focus is on the toggle button and the button is inactive, this action activates the button.
- If focus is on an active button, this actions keeps the button active.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is inside the toggle button group, this action moves focus out of the component. Focus is set to the previous component in the tab order.
- If focus is below the toggle button group, this action move focus into the toggle button group. Focus is set to the active button.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Right arrow / Down arrow">

- This action moves focus to the next toggle button in the toggle button group.
- If focus is on the last toggle button, this action wraps focus to the first toggle button.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Left arrow / Up arrow">

- This action moves focus to the previous toggle button in the toggle button group.
- If focus is on the first toggle button, this action wraps focus to the last toggle button.
