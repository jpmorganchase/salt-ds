### Best practises

#### When a Button has both an icon and a label

- Pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to the icon so that its label is not announced by screen readers.

#### When a Button has an icon only and no label

- Pass an `aria-label` to Button that describes its purpose.

### Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is above the button, Tab key press moves focus onto the button.
- If the button is disabled and is set to receive focus, receives focus.
- If the button has focus, Tab moves focus out of the button, to next focusable component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab + Shift">

- If focused, Tab+Shift combo moves focus out of the component to the previous component in the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- If the button has focus, Enter or Space key press activates the button.
- If the button is disabled and can receive focus, does nothing.

</KeyboardControl>
