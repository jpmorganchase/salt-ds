## Best practices

Check and test any focusable elements included in the banner content.

When using a banner to alert the user, apply `role="alert"`. When using a banner to notify the user, apply `role="status"`.

* **Note:**  There are known screen reader announcement issues when dynamically inserting content with `role="status"`. 
During your testing, if you find that adding `role="status"` to the banner does not properly announce conent using a screen reader, 
we recommend preloading a container with `role="status"` that will house the banner. That will ensure the content is properly announced via screen reader.
