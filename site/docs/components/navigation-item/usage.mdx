## Using the component

For further details on how to use the component to provide navigation, see the [navigation pattern](/salt/patterns/navigation/)

### Routing libraries

If you are using a routing library such as [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing), you can use the `render` prop to render a link component from the routing library. This allows you to take advantage of the routing library's features, such as client-side navigation and route matching.

### When to use

- When you have multiple levels of navigation in your application or website.
- We suggest first considering a horizontal group of navigation items for distinct webpages or applications. If you have multiple (more than eight) services to navigate to at a platform level, or have navigation across distinct apps, consider using a vertical group instead.
- If you need your items to remain visible on scroll, we recommend displaying navigation items in a fixed app header (or header area).

### When not to use

- When you need to show different views of content within the same page. Instead, use [`Tabs`](/salt/components/tabs/).
- When your content is very specific. In this case, a minimalistic or single-page design may be more appropriate than a complex navigation structure. Instead, use [`InteractableCard`](../card), or [`Link`](../link) within the body of the page.

## Content

- To make the most of screen real estate, our recommendation is that all description text should be clear and concise.
- Always write descriptions in sentence case in a navigation item.
- When using a navigation item component within a navigation item, we recommend using sentence case.
- In a horizontal navigation item, do not wrap descriptions, use truncation with `Tooltip` if necessary.
- In a vertical navigation item, descriptions can wrap onto multiple lines if necessary, and is preferred over truncation.

## Import

To import `NavigationItem` from the core Salt package, use:

```
import { NavigationItem  } from "@salt-ds/core";
```
