## Horizontal group

Use horizontal navigation items within a horizontal group to establish a consistent and easily accessible pathway for users, while conserving valuable screen estate. This will allow users to easily scan and identify navigation options in a seamless user experience.

### Best practices

Use a horizontal group of navigation items when you have fewer than eight items, otherwise consider a vertical group of items.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="HorizontalGroup" />

<Callout variant="secondary" status="warning">

A new component ([VerticalNavigation](/salt/components/vertical-navigation)) has been introduced to replace the existing NavigationItem component for vertical navigation. The new component provides a more structured and flexible way to create vertical navigation. For now you can continue to use the NavigationItem component, but we recommend migrating to the new [VerticalNavigation](/salt/components/vertical-navigation) component as the NavigationItem component will be deprecated in a future release and removed in the future major release.

## Vertical group

A vertical navigation group provides a simple, single-level list of links that users can select within an application or website.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="VerticalGroup" />

## Vertical group nested

Use vertical navigation when handling a hierarchical structure of nested pages. This configuration allows users to reveal nested items when selecting a parent item, making it easy to explore the content hierarchy.

When the user collapses a vertical nested group, and there is an active nested item within it, the parent item should be configured with `blurActive={true}`. The indicator will stay on the parent item in the blur-active state. This tells the user that the active item is within this nested structure.

You can use a navigation item as a parent which nests other navigation items inside it. Parent navigation items are displayed with a chevron on the right-hand side. To set a navigation item as a parent, use the `parent` prop.

### Best practices

If a navigation item has nested items within it, it will act as a trigger to show and hide the nested items. A parent item cannot act as a link and navigate to an overview page. If you require an overview page, use the first nested item to achieve this.

<LivePreview
  componentName="navigation-item"
  exampleName="VerticalNestedGroup"
/>

## With icon

Use an icon to effectively signify the navigation item’s purpose, whether it’s related to a product’s identity, a specific tool, function, or a configuration setting.

### Best practices

Ensure that you use icon descriptors consistently across all items within the same hierarchy level. This helps keep them equally weighted.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="WithIcon" />

## With badge

You can add a [badge](../badge) to a navigation item to serve as a visual cue. A badge can inform users of additional context, notifications, signpost new content or indicate a status.

### Best practices

Only place a badge in a navigation item that does not include nested items, i.e., it will not have a chevron.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="WithBadge" />
