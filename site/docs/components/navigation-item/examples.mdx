## Default (Horizontal)

By default the navigation item is oriented horizontally.

### Best practices

A navigation item hugs its content by default, but you can customize it and adjust its container to fit any preferred width.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="Default" />

## Vertical

To change the orientation of the navigation item, you can use the vertical orientation prop.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="Vertical" />

## With icon

Use an icon to effectively signify the navigation item’s purpose, whether it’s related to a product’s identity, a specific tool, function, or a configuration setting.

### Best practices

Ensure that you use icon descriptors consistently across all items within the same hierarchy level. This helps keep them equally weighted.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="WithIcon" />

## With badge

You can add a [badge](../badge) to a navigation item to serve as a visual cue. A badge can inform users of additional context, notifications, signpost new content or indicate a status.

### Best practices

Only place a badge in a navigation item that does not include nested items, i.e., it will not have a chevron.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="WithBadge" />

## With nested items

You can use a navigation item as a parent which nests other navigation items inside it. Parent navigation items are displayed with a chevron on the right-hand side. To set a navigation item as a parent, use the `parent` prop.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="WithNestedItems" />

## Horizontal group

Use horizontal navigation items within a horizontal group to establish a consistent and easily accessible pathway for users, while conserving valuable screen estate. This will allow users to easily scan and identify navigation options in a seamless user experience.

### Best practices

Use a horizontal group of navigation items when you have fewer than eight items, otherwise consider a vertical group of items.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="HorizontalGroup" />

## Vertical group

A vertical navigation group provides a simple, single-level list of links that users can select within an application or website.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="VerticalGroup" />

## Vertical group nested

Use vertical navigation when handling a hierarchical structure of nested pages. This configuration allows users to reveal nested items when selecting a parent item, making it easy to explore the content hierarchy.

### Best practices

If a navigation item has nested items within it, it will act as a trigger to show and hide the nested items. A parent item cannot act as a link and navigate to an overview page. If you require an overview page, use the first nested item to achieve this.

<LivePreview
  componentName="navigation-item"
  exampleName="VerticalNestedGroup"
/>

## Blur-active

When the user collapses a vertical nested group, and there is an active nested item within it, the parent item should be configured with `blurActive={true}`. The indicator will stay on the parent item in the blur-active state. This tells the user that the active item is within this nested structure.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="BlurActive" />

## Render prop - element

Using the `render` prop, you can customize the element rendered by the `NavigationItem`.
Props defined on the JSX element will be merged with props from the `NavigationItem`.

A `NavigationItem` will either act as a link, or an expandable group for other `NavigationItem` elements.
When a parent group is clicked, the group will expand or collapse.
When a link is clicked, navigates the user to the specified `href`.

The default element for parent groups is `<button>`, whilst a link will use `<a>`.

### Prop merging

```tsx
<NavigationItem href="/your-page" render={<a target="_blank" />}>
  ...
</NavigationItem>
```

will be created in the DOM as an `<a>` with merged props

```tsx
<a href="/your-page" target="_blank">
  ...
</a>
```

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="RenderElement" />

## Render prop - callback

Using the `render` prop, you can customize the element rendered by the `NavigationItem`.

The `render` prop can also accept a function. This approach allows more control over how props are merged, allowing for more precise customization of the component's behavior.

When a function is passed to the `render` prop, it's your responsibility to merge props within the function itself.

<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="RenderProp" />
