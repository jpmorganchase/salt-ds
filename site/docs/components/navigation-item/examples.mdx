<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="Default">

### Default (Horizontal)

By default the Navigation Item is oriented horizontally.

#### Guidance

A Navigation Item hugs its content by default, but is customisable so that its container can be adjusted to fit any preferred width.
</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="Vertical">

### Vertical

To change the orientation of the Navigation Item you can use the vertical orientation prop.
</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="WithIcon">

### With Icon

Use an icon to effectively signify the Navigation Item’s purpose, whether it’s related to a product’s identity, a specific tool, function, or a configuration setting.

#### Guidance

Ensure that icon descriptors are used consistently across all items within the same hierarchy level. This helps keep them equally weighted.
</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="WithBadge">

### With Badge

You can add a badge to a Navigation Item to serve as a visual cue. A badge can inform users of additional context, notifications, signpost new content or indicate a status.

#### Guidance

A badge should only be placed in a Navigation Item that does not include nested items, i.e., it will not have a chevron.
</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="WithNestedItems">

### With nested items

You can use a Navigation Item as a parent which nests other Navigation Items inside it. Parent Navigation Items are displayed with a chevron on the right-hand side. To set a Navigation Item as a parent use the `Parent` prop.
</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="HorizontalGroup">

### Horizontal group

Use horizontal Navigation Items within a horizontal group to establish a consistent and easily accessible pathway for users, while conserving valuable screen estate. Users will be able to easily scan and identify navigation options in a seamless user experience.

#### Guidance

Use a horizontal group of Navigation Items when you have fewer than eight items, otherwise consider a vertical group of items.
</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="VerticalGroup">

### Vertical group

A vertical navigation group provides a simple, single-level list of links that users can select within an application or website.
</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="navigation-item" exampleName="VerticalNestedGroup">

### Vertical group nested

Use vertical navigation when handling a hierarchical structure of nested pages. This configuration allows users to reveal nested items when selecting a parent item, facilitating an intuitive exploration of the content hierarchy.

When a vertical nested group is collapsed, and there is an active nested item within it, the parent item will obtain a blur-active state.

#### Guidance

If a Navigation Item has nested items within it, it will act as a trigger to show and hide the nested items. A parent item cannot act as a link and navigate to an overview page. If you require an overview page, use the first nested item to achieve this.
