### How to use the Split Layout component

#### When to use Split Layout

- If you need two defined areas at the opposite horizontal ends of a container, for example if you need two Button Bar components in a header.

#### When not to use Split Layout

- If your layout requires more than two regions. Instead, use [Flow Layout](/salt/components/flow-layout).
- If you want more complex customization in your layout, consider [Flex Layout](/salt/components/flex-layout).
