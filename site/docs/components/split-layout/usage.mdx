### When to use Split Layout

- If there are two defined areas required to be at the opposite horizontal ends of a container, for example if two Button Bar components need to be in a header.

### When not to use Split Layout

- If your layout requires more than two regions. In this case we recommend you use [Flow Layout](/salt/components/flow-layout) instead.

- If You want the layout to have more complex customization we recommend having a look at [Flex Layout](/salt/components/flex-layout).
