## Best practices

When building a sub-section of a page using a split layout, it's important to use semantic HTML, which means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

`SplitLayout` supports semantic HTML with the `as` prop. This renders the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.

```tsx
<SplitLayout
  as="ul"
  startItem={<FlexItem as="li">List item</FlexItem>}
  endItem={<FlexItem as="li">List item</FlexItem>}
/>
```
