When building a sub-section of a page using Split Layout, you should use semantic HTML. This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

Split Layout supports semantic HTML with the `as` prop. This renders the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.

```tsx
<SplitLayout
  as="ul"
  startItem={<FlexItem as="li">List item</FlexItem>}
  endItem={<FlexItem as="li">List item</FlexItem>}
/>
```
