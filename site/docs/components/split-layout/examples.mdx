## Default

Split layouts display items horizontally at either end of the container by default with its items aligned centrally in the layout.

The items drive the height and width of the overall layout.

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="Default" />

## Layout direction

The split layout `direction` prop defines the main axis along which items are displayed. By default, `direction` is set to `row`, arranging items horizontally. Setting `direction` to `column` arranges items vertically along a single line.

The values `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` can be used to reverse the order of items along the main axis, displaying them in the opposite direction.

## Button bar

This example shows two groups of buttons inside a split layout, such as within an app header. Here, the split layout is in its default configuration.

## Responsive layout

The split layout component supports responsive props, so you can define different behaviors based on viewport size. You can use the default [Salt breakpoints](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/foundations/responsiveness) or pass in your own using `SaltProvider`.

### Responsive props

A responsive prop is a prop that takes either multiple values (one value per breakpoint), or a single value that affects all screen sizes. For example, a layout that will responsively change direction from row to column at specific breakpoints or viewport sizes:

```js
direction={{ xs: "column", sm: "column", lg: "row", md: "row ", xl: "row" }}
```

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="ResponsiveLayout" />

## Layout alignment

Control the position of the split layout and its items using the `align` prop.

If there is additional space available around the layout (i.e., above or below the row, or beside the column) use the `align` prop to position items within that space.

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="LayoutAlignment" />

## Flex item position

Use the flex item component's `align` prop to set an alignment for a specific item in the layout. Use the `align` prop to change the item’s position along the cross-axis of the layout (i.e., perpendicular to the `direction`–`row` or `column`).

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="FlexItemPosition" />

## Flex item size

The flex item component's `grow` prop enables specific items in the layout to grow and fill any remaining space that is available in the layout:

- By default, `grow` is set to 0 and items will display in their normal size.
- If you set an item to 1, it will fill the available space.
- If you set an item to 2, it will fill twice as much space as items that have `grow` set to 1.

In contrast to the `grow` prop, the `shrink` prop shrinks specific items as small as possible within the layout. By default, `shrink` is set to 1. If an item is set to 2, that item would attempt to take half as much space.

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="FlexItemSize" />

## Spacing

Split layout displays items with a gap between items that is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing) controlled by the `gap` property and is by default set to 3.

The spacing properties `padding` and `margin` are set to 0 by default and can be used to control the layout's inner and outer spacing (also as multiples of the Salt base unit).
