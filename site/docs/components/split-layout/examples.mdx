### Default

By default, Split Layout displays items horizontally at either end of the container.

Its items align centrally within the layout, with a `gap` between items of 3, which is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing). The height and width of the layout are driven by the items contained within it.

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="ColumnDirection" >

### Column direction

The Split Layout `direction` prop defines the main axis that items are displayed along. Set `direction` to `column` to display items in a vertical direction along a single line.

### Button bar

This example shows two groups of buttons inside a Split Layout e.g within an App Header. Here Split Layout is being used with its default configuration.

### Responsive layout

Split Layout supports responsive props, so you can define different behaviors based on viewport size. You can use the default [Salt breakpoints](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/foundations/responsiveness) or pass in your own using `SaltProvider`.

What are responsive props?

A responsive prop is a prop that takes either multiple values (one value per breakpoint), or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes. For example, a layout that will responsively change direction from row to column at specific breakpoints or viewport sizes:

```js
direction={{ xs: "column", sm: "column", lg: "row", md: "row ", xl: "row" }}
```

### Layout alignment

Control the position of Split Layout and its items using the `align` prop.

If there is additional space available around the layout (i.e., above or below the row, or beside the column) use the `align` prop to define how items should be positioned within that space.

### Flex item position

Use the Flex Item `align` prop to set an alignment for a specific item in the layout. Use the `align` prop to change the item’s position along the cross-axis of the layout (i.e., perpendicular to the `direction`–`row` or `column`).

### Flex item size

The Flex Item `grow` prop enables specific items in the layout to grow and fill any remaining space that is available in the layout:

By default, `grow` is set to 0 and items will be displayed in their ‘normal’ size.

If an item is set to ‘1’ it will fill the available space.

If an item is set to ‘2’ it will fill twice as much space as other items that have `grow` set to ‘1’.

#### Guidance

In contrast to the `grow` prop, the `shrink` prop specific item as small as possible within the layout. By default, `shrink` is set to `1`. If an item is set to `2`, that item would attempt to take half as much space.
