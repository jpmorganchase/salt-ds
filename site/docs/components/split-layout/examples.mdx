<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="Default" >

### Default

Split layouts display items horizontally at either end of the container by default.

Its items align centrally in the layout, with a `gap` between items of 3, which is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing). The items drive the height and width of the overall layout.

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="ColumnDirection" >

### Column direction

The split layout `direction` prop defines the main axis that items are displayed along. Set `direction` to `column` to display items in a vertical direction along a single line.

### Button bar

This example shows two groups of buttons inside a split layout, such as within an app header. Here, the split layout is in its default configuration.

### Responsive layout

The split layout component supports responsive props, so you can define different behaviors based on viewport size. You can use the default [Salt breakpoints](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/foundations/responsiveness) or pass in your own using `SaltProvider`.

#### Responsive props

A responsive prop is a prop that takes either multiple values (one value per breakpoint), or a single value that affects all screen sizes. For example, a layout that will responsively change direction from row to column at specific breakpoints or viewport sizes:

```js
direction={{ xs: "column", sm: "column", lg: "row", md: "row ", xl: "row" }}
```

### Layout alignment

Control the position of the split layout and its items using the `align` prop.

If there is additional space available around the layout (i.e., above or below the row, or beside the column) use the `align` prop to position items within that space.

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="FlexItemPosition" >

### Flex item position

Use the flex item component's `align` prop to set an alignment for a specific item in the layout. Use the `align` prop to change the item’s position along the cross-axis of the layout (i.e., perpendicular to the `direction`–`row` or `column`).

<LivePreview componentName="split-layout" exampleName="FlexItemSize" >

### Flex item size

The flex item component's `grow` prop enables specific items in the layout to grow and fill any remaining space that is available in the layout:

- By default, `grow` is set to 0 and items will display in their normal size.
- If you set an item to 1, it will fill the available space.
- If you set an item to 2, it will fill twice as much space as items that have `grow` set to 1.

In contrast to the `grow` prop, the `shrink` prop shrinks specific items as small as possible within the layout. By default, `shrink` is set to 1. If an item is set to 2, that item would attempt to take half as much space.
