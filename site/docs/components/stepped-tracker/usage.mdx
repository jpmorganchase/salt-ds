### When to use Stepped Tracker

- If there are separate steps within a process such as a wizard or a multi-step form.

- Where a process can be broken into distinct, bite-sized sections that are less daunting than lengthy forms.

### When not to use Stepped Tracker

- If there are fewer than three steps in a process.

- As navigation; the steps are not interactable.

### Content

Stepped Tracker labels never truncate, only wrap. Therefore, ensure they are short and self-explanatory.

### Import

To import Salt Provider from the lab Salt package (will be core eventually), use:

```
import { SteppedTracker, TrackerStep, StepLabel } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```
