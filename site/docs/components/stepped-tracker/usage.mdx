### Using the components

#### When to use

- When there are separate steps within a process, such as a wizard or a multistep form.
- When you want to split a process into distinct, bite-sized sections that are less daunting than lengthy forms.

#### When not to use

- When there are fewer than three steps in a process.
- As navigation; users cannot interact with the steps.
