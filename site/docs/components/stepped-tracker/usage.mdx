### Using the `SteppedTracker` component

#### When to use `SteppedTracker`

- When there are separate steps within a process, such as a wizard or a multistep form.
- When you want to split a process into distinct, bite-sized sections that are less daunting than lengthy forms.

#### When not to use `SteppedTracker`

- When there are fewer than three steps in a process.
- As navigation; users cannot interact with the steps.

### Content

Stepped tracker labels never truncate, only wrap. Therefore, ensure they're short and self-explanatory.

```
import { SteppedTracker, TrackerStep, StepLabel } from "@salt-ds/lab";
```
