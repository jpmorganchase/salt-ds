## Orientation

### Horizontal (default)

<LivePreview
  componentName="stepped-tracker"
  exampleName="OrientationHorizontal"
/>

### Vertical

<LivePreview
  componentName="stepped-tracker"
  exampleName="OrientationVertical"
/>

## Stage + Status

The `Step` component changes based on the `stage` and `status` props.
In case they are both set, `status` will take precedence over `stage`.
These 2 props control various aspects of the component, such as:
icon selection, description text color and track (connector) style.

## Nested Steps

When using the `SteppedTracker` component in vertical orientation, you can
nest `Step` components other `Step` components. When done so, the parent
`Step` renders another `SteppedTracker` and places the nested `Steps`
(children) inside of it. Additionally an expand button is added on the parent
`Step` to expand or collapse the substeps. The parent Step containing the
active Step child children are to have a stage of `inprogress`.

## Hook

The `SteppedTracker` and `Step` component are purely presentational components.
If you want to control the state of the `SteppedTracker` you can utilize the `useStepReducer` hook.

<LivePreview componentName="stepped-tracker" exampleName="Hook" />

The `useStepReducer` hook is smart! If you add `stage: 'active'` to any step,
it will automatically determine the stages of all other steps (autoStage),
both before and after the active one. Inside the state object, you can find
useful properties such as `steps`, `flatSteps`, `activeStep`, `previousStep`,
`nextStep`, `started` and `ended`. The dispatch method as in the native
useReducer hook accepts an action object with a type. Acceptable action types
are: 'next', 'previous', 'warning', 'error' and 'clear'. The warning and error
types will set the status of the active step to 'warning' or 'error'. The
clear type will reset the status of the active step to undefined.
