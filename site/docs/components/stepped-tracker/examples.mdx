    ### Basic

    Stepped Tracker contains multiple `TrackerStep` child components. Each `TrackerStep` indicates its current status through its icon and color. In addition, the connectors indicate the current active step and the userâ€™s progress through the process.

    A label can be added to the `TrackerStep` using the `StepLabel` component.

    ### Step Progression

    In normal circumstances, once a step is completed you should both advance the active step, and change the status of the current active step in unison.

    ### Non-Sequential Progress

    It may not be appropriate in some circumstances, but it is possible to control the state of steps and the active step independently if users are able to revisit previous steps or complete steps non-sequentially.
