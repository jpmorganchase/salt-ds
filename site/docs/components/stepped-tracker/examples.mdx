The SteppedTracker contains multiple TrackerStep child components. Each TrackerStep indicates its status through its icon. The connectors indicate current active step progress through the process. You should add a label to the TrackerStep using the StepLabel component as follows:

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="component-name" exampleName="ComponentExample" title="Step Progression">

In normal circumstances, once a step is completed you should both advance the active step, and change the status of the current active step in unison.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="component-name" exampleName="ComponentExample" title="Auto Progression">

It may however be appropriate to control the state of steps, and the active step independently if users are able to revisit previous steps or complete step non-sequentially.
