    ### Basic

    `SteppedTracker` contains multiple `TrackerStep` child components. Each `TrackerStep` indicates its current status through its icon and color. In addition, the connectors indicate the current active step and the userâ€™s progress through the process.

    You can add a label to the `TrackerStep` using the `StepLabel` component.

    ### Step progression

    In normal circumstances, once the user completes a step, you should advance the active step, and change the status of the current active step in unison.

    ### Nonsequential progress

    It may not be appropriate in some circumstances, but it's possible to control the state of steps and the active step independently if users can revisit previous steps or complete steps nonsequentially.
