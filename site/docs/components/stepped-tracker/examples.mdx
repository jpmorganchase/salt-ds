## Basic

`SteppedTracker` contains multiple `TrackerStep` child components. Each `TrackerStep` indicates its current status through its icon and color. In addition, the connectors indicate the current active step and the user’s progress through the process.

You can add a label to the `TrackerStep` using the `StepLabel` component.

  <LivePreview componentName="stepped-tracker" exampleName="Vertical" >

## Vertical

    The Stepped Tracker can be vertically oriented, with labels displayed on the right of the icon in the step node.

### Guidance

Use a vertical stepped tracker when horizontal space is limited in the context of the application or when there are a large number of steps in the process – for example, more than 8.

## Step progression

In normal circumstances, once the user completes a step, you should advance the active step, and change the status of the current active step in unison.

## Nonsequential progress

It may not be appropriate in some circumstances, but it's possible to control the state of steps and the active step independently if users can revisit previous steps or complete steps nonsequentially.
