## Keyboard interactions

Keyboard interactions apply to only Steppers with steps with nested substeps.
In those cases the parent step renders automatically a button that allows
for expanding or collapsing the substeps.

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Moves the focus down to the next expand button.
- By default all steps with substeps are collapsed, meaning only top level
  expand buttons will be focusable. Initially the top most step will be focused.
- If the substeps contain more substeps, the focus will move to the inside steps only if the parent is expanded.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- Moves the focus up to the previous expand button.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- Applicable to only steps with substeps. Those steps are in the collapsed state by default. Using this action on an the arrow button expands or collapses the step.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
