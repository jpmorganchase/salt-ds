## Best practices

Wrap `NumberInput` in [`FormField`](/salt/components/form-field) to provide the field with a visible label, help text and a status message for validation feedback. This will ensure it complies with accessibility guidelines. You can find more information [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

## Keyboard interactions

Number input inherits keyboard interactions from [`Input`](/salt/components/input/accessibility).

The following interactions are specific to `NumberInput`.

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up arrow">

When the input area has focus, Up arrow increases the number by the increment value (default to 1), up to the maximum value if set.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Up arrow">
 
When the input area has focus, this action increases the number by a multiple of the standard step size (default to 2).

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Page up">

When the input area has focus, Page up increases the number by a multiple of the standard step size (default to 2), up to the maximum value if set.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="End">

When the input area has focus, End increases the number to the maximum value.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Down arrow">

When the input area has focus, Down arrow decresases the number by the increment value (default to 1), up to the minimum value if set.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Down arrow">
 
When the input area has focus, this action decreases the number by a multiple of the step size (default to 2), up to the maximum value if set.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Page down">
 
When the input area has focus, Page down decreases the number by a multiple of the step size (default to 2), up to the maximum value if set.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Home">

When the input area has focus, Home decreases the number to the minimum value.
