## Primary

The `NumberInput`, by default, features an increment `step` of 1, enabling precise value adjustments. For larger value adjustments, users can utilize the `Shift` key in combination with the `Arrow` keys to apply a `stepMultiplier` which is 2 by default.

The default variant for `NumberInput` is "primary."

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Primary" />

## Secondary

`NumberInput` has a "secondary" variant.

For recommendations on variant choice, see the [forms pattern](salt/patterns/forms).

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Secondary" />

## Disabled

The `NumberInput` can be disabled to prevent any user interaction or input.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Read-only

You can set `NumberInput` to a read-only state. The user can't edit the value text in this state, but they can highlight and copy it.

By default, the marker is an em dash. If your application requires a different marker, you can set it via the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop.

- Use the read-only state when the user needs the value for their flow or current task but cannot edit it, for example, because of user permissions.

**Note:** To address browser and screen reader limitations in conveying a read-only state, the `NumberInput`'s role is changed to `textbox` when set to read-only.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="ReadOnly" />

## Placeholder

You can use a placeholder to prompt user input if there's no default value.

### Best practices

Never use placeholder text to provide the user with contextual help since it will disappear when the user starts typing and doesn't meet minimum contrast requirements. Doing so is a WCAG failure.

Instead, use helper text beneath the field to provide instructions or directions necessary to complete the field, and reserve the placeholder text to support the help message, or provide an example of the suggested content.

You can find more information [in the W3C form instructions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/).

## Decimals

By default, the `NumberInput` component is configured to accept values with zero decimal places. However, if users need to input values with decimals, such as monetary amounts, the number of decimal places can be customized through the `decimalScale` prop.

When a user enters a value that doesn't align with the specified decimal places, the component will automatically adjust the value to the correct number of decimal places once it loses focus. For instance, if the component is set to accept two decimal places and the user inputs "12," it will display "12.00."

Additionally, the component will round values up or down as needed to ensure they conform to the specified number of decimal places.

### Best practices

When configuring the number of decimal places, ensure it aligns with the specific use case. For example, when dealing with currencies such as pounds sterling or U.S. dollars in a retail context, limit the decimal places to two, as these currencies typically require only two decimal places for accuracy. Avoid using three decimal places in such scenarios to maintain consistency and relevance.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Decimals" />

## Min and max value

To limit the range of accepted values, you can specify a minimum, maximum, or both using the `min` and `max` props.

### Best practices

- Clearly communicate the accepted value range by utilizing the `FormField`'s helper text to guide users.
- Use the `FormField` error state to alert users when they manually enter a value outside the permitted range, indicating that the input is invalid.

By specifying just `min` and `max` you can create an error state for out of range values.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="MinMax" />

Alternatively, a more strict implementation, can limit entry to only in-range values.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="StrictMinMax" />

## Custom steps

You can customize the `step` of the `NumberInput` to tailor to your use-case. The `stepMultiplier` is used in combination with the keyboard controls to provide an alternative step value.

### Best practices

- Choose a `step` value that represents the most common or desired input for the majority of users, such as the number most frequently submitted.
- Make sure the `step` value is suitable for the context. For example, when users are inputting a "Number of people," increments of 0.5 may cause confusion. If unsure, maintain the step at 1 to ensure clarity and simplicity.

## Formatting

Number formatting is provided through [react-number-format](https://s-yadav.github.io/react-number-format/)

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Formatting" />

## Negative values

Negative values can be entered by default.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Negative" />

## Custom Formatter

The `format` prop enables a custom formatter to be added

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="CustomFormatting" />{" "}

## Button adornments

You can add a custom [Button](/salt/components/button) at the end of the `NumberInput` using the `endAdornment` prop. This allows for custom interactivity within the input field.

When using `endAdornment` buttons for tasks such as reset or synchronization, it is essential to provide immediate feedback to users, especially those using screen readers. Implementing an `aria-live` region ensures that screen readers announce dynamic content changes, keeping users informed about actions such as resetting or synchronizing the input field. This improves user understanding and interaction with the application.

**Reset adornment**:

Use a reset button to return the `NumberInput` to its default value.

**Synchronize adornment**:

Synchronize the `NumberInput` with a live value from a constantly changing source, such as live stock prices. The `NumberInput`'s value does not automatically update with changes in the live value. In this scenario, the synchronize button appears when the displayed value and live value differ.

**Custom buttons**:

Customize the positioning and appearance of `NumberInput`'s arrow buttons to align with specific product requirements or constraints.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="ButtonAdornments" />

## Validation

The `NumberInput` can display validation states, `error`, `warning`, and `success`, through the `validationStatus` prop.

### Best practices

- **Error state**: Utilize the error state to notify users of a critical issue related to the input. This issue may hinder task completion and typically requires user intervention to resolve.
- **Warning state** Use the warning state to caution users about a potential issue. While this issue won't stop users from proceeding with the task, it may lead to errors if not addressed.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Validation" />

## Text alignment

Text has left alignment by default. Use the `textAlign` prop to change the alignment to “center” or “right.”

Numeric values often have right alignment to make comparing them easier. However, sometimes number fields don't relate to each other or mix with text fields in a form, so left alignment may promote better visual flow. Consider your use case when deciding on input field alignment.

### Best practices

- Right alignment is often used for numeric values to facilitate easier comparison. However, if number fields are mixed with text fields or do not relate to each other, left alignment may enhance the overall visual flow.
- Center alignment can be used to emphasize a particular value, but it should be applied sparingly and only in exceptional cases to avoid disrupting the visual consistency.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="TextAlignment" />

## Bordered

To apply a full border to the `NumberInput`, you can use the `bordered` prop. This styling is particularly effective when the input field shares the same fill color as the background, such as using a primary fill color on a primary background.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Bordered" />
