## Default

The `NumberInput`, by default, features an increment `step` of 1, enabling precise value adjustments. For larger value adjustments, users can utilize the `Shift` key in combination with the `Arrow` keys to apply a `stepMultiplier` which is 2 by default.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Default" />

## Variants

The `NumberInput` is available in two variants: `primary` and `secondary`. The default variant is `primary` but you can switch to `secondary` using the `variant` prop.

When deciding between the `primary` and `secondary` variants, take into account the background color where the component will be displayed.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Variants" />

## Bordered

To apply a full border to the `NumberInput`, you can use the `bordered` prop. This styling is particularly effective when the input field shares the same fill color as the background, such as using a primary fill color on a primary background.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Bordered" />

## Validation

The `NumberInput` can display validation states, `error`, `warning`, and `success`, through the `validationStatus` prop.

### Best practices

- **Error state**: Utilize the error state to notify users of a critical issue related to the input. This issue may hinder task completion and typically requires user intervention to resolve.
- **Warning state** Use the warning state to caution users about a potential issue. While this issue won't stop users from proceeding with the task, it may lead to errors if not addressed.

## Decimals

By default, the `NumberInput` component is configured to accept values with zero decimal places. However, if users need to input values with decimals, such as monetary amounts, the number of decimal places can be customized through the `decimalPlaces` prop.

When a user enters a value that doesn't align with the specified decimal places, the component will automatically adjust the value to the correct number of decimal places once it loses focus. For instance, if the component is set to accept two decimal places and the user inputs "12," it will display "12.00."

Additionally, the component will round values up or down as needed to ensure they conform to the specified number of decimal places.

### Best practices

When configuring the number of decimal places, ensure it aligns with the specific use case. For example, when dealing with currencies such as pounds sterling or U.S. dollars in a retail context, limit the decimal places to two, as these currencies typically require only two decimal places for accuracy. Avoid using three decimal places in such scenarios to maintain consistency and relevance.

## Min and max value

To limit the range of accepted values, you can specify a minimum, maximum, or both using the `min` and `max` props.

### Best practices

- Clearly communicate the accepted value range by utilizing the `FormField`'s helper text to guide users.
- Use the `FormField` error state to alert users when they manually enter a value outside the permitted range, indicating that the input is invalid.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Limits" />

## Custom steps

You can customize the `default` value of the `NumberInput` along with `step` and `stepMultiplier` to tailor the values according to your usecase.

### Best practices

- Choose a `default` value that represents the most common or desired input for the majority of users, such as the number most frequently submitted.
- Make sure the `step` value is suitable for the context. For example, when users are inputting a "Number of people," increments of 0.5 may cause confusion. If unsure, maintain the step at 1 to ensure clarity and simplicity.

## Button adornments

You can add a custom [Button](/salt/components/button) at the end of the `NumberInput` using the `endAdornment` prop. This allows for custom interactivity within the input field.

When using `endAdornment` buttons for tasks such as reset or synchronization, it is essential to provide immediate feedback to users, especially those using screen readers. Implementing an `aria-live` region ensures that screen readers announce dynamic content changes, keeping users informed about actions such as resetting or synchronizing the input field. This improves user understanding and interaction with the application.

**Reset adornment**:

Use a reset button to return the `NumberInput` to its default value.

**Synchronize adornment**:

Synchronize the `NumberInput` with a live value from a constantly changing source, such as live stock prices. The `NumberInput`'s value does not automatically update with changes in the live value. In this scenario, the synchronize button appears when the displayed value and live value differ.

**Custom buttons**:

Customize the positioning and appearance of `NumberInput`'s arrow buttons to align with specific product requirements or constraints.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="ButtonAdornments" />

## Disabled

The `NumberInput` can be disabled to prevent any user interaction or input.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Read-only

The `NumberInput` can be set to a read-only state using the `readOnly` prop, allowing users to highlight and copy the value without editing it.

By default, an em dash is used as the marker. If your application requires a different marker, you can customize it using the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop.

**Note:** To address browser and screen reader limitations in conveying a read-only state, the `NumberInput`'s role is changed to `textbox` when set to read-only.

### Best practices

Utilize the read-only state when users need to view the value for their workflow or current task but are not permitted to edit it, such as due to user permissions.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Readonly" />

## Text alignment

To maintain a cohesive visual flow, numeric values are left-aligned by default, positioned directly beneath the label and other form field elements. If your specific use case or layout requires a different alignment, you can adjust the `NumberInput` to be right or center aligned using the `textAlign` prop.

### Best practices

- Right alignment is often used for numeric values to facilitate easier comparison. However, if number fields are mixed with text fields or do not relate to each other, left alignment may enhance the overall visual flow.
- Center alignment can be used to emphasize a particular value, but it should be applied sparingly and only in exceptional cases to avoid disrupting the visual consistency.
