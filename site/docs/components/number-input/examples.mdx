## Default

The `NumberInput` has a default increment step of 1, which is adjustable via the `step` prop for precise value changes. For larger adjustments, users can hold the Shift key while using the arrow keys to apply a `stepMultiplier`, a prop that defaults to 2.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Default" />

## Variants

The `NumberInput` is available in two variants: primary and secondary. The default variant is primary but you can switch to secondary using the `variant` prop.

When deciding between the primary and secondary variants, take into account the background color where the component will be displayed.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Variants" />

## Bordered

By default, the `NumberInput` is transparent. You can add borders using the `bordered` prop.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Bordered" />

## Min and max value

To limit the range of accepted values, you can specify a minimum, maximum, or both using the `min` and `max` props.

### Best practices

- Clearly communicate the accepted value range by utilizing the `FormField`'s helper text to guide users.
- Use the `FormField` error state to alert users when they manually enter a value outside the permitted range, indicating that the input is invalid.
- Use the `clamp` prop to enforce the value to be within range.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Limits" />

## Clamp behaviour

By default, even when minimum and maximum values are specified, they are not strictly enforced, allowing users to type values outside this range. However, by setting the prop `clamp` to true, the
input will automatically adjust to the nearest minimum or maximum value when the input field loses focus.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="ClampBehaviour" />

## Validation

The `NumberInput` can display validation states, `error`, `warning`, and `success`, through the `validationStatus` prop.

### Best practices

- **Error state**: Utilize the error state to notify users of a critical issue related to the input. This issue may hinder task completion and typically requires user intervention to resolve.
- **Warning state** Use the warning state to caution users about a potential issue. While this issue won't stop users from proceeding with the task, it may lead to errors if not addressed.

## Decimal scale

By default, the decimal scale is derived from the highest number of decimal places found in the `step` prop, or if not defined, in either the `defaultValue` or `value` prop.
However, you can set it to any value of your choice using the `decimalScale` prop and that will have priority.

### Best practices

When configuring the number of decimal places, ensure it aligns with the specific use case. For example, when dealing with currencies such as pounds sterling or U.S. dollars in a retail context, limit the decimal places to two, as these currencies typically require only two decimal places for accuracy. Avoid using three decimal places in such scenarios to maintain consistency and relevance.

## Formatting

You can format the value of the `NumberInput` using the `format` callback prop. It typically works alongside a `parse` callback for complex formatting.

Users will be able to see the formatted value in the input, e.g. "5K". When the input gains focus, the value will be parsed into its numerical form, so "5K" becomes "5000". This allows users to edit the values with precision. When the input loses focus, the value will be formatted again.

### Best practices

The `format` callback has been designed to work with most formatting libraries, e.g. Intl.NumberFormat. However, it is highly recommended to provide a `parse` callback alongside `format` to determine the correct numerical value so the precision of the value can be maintained.

**Note**: If a `format` callback is provided, it will override the `decimalScale`, enabling you to handle decimal place rules directly within your formatting function.

## Custom steps

The `step` prop allows you to define the increment and decrement sizes for value adjustments.

### Best practices

Make sure the `step` value is suitable for the context. For example, when users are inputting a "Number of people," increments of 0.5 may cause confusion. If unsure, maintain the step at 1 to ensure clarity and simplicity.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="StepAndBlock" />

## Button adornments

You can add a custom [Button](/salt/components/button) at the end of the `NumberInput` using the `endAdornment` prop. This allows for custom interactivity within the input field.

When using `endAdornment` buttons for tasks such as reset or synchronization, it is essential to provide immediate feedback to users, especially those using screen readers. Implementing an `aria-live` region ensures that screen readers announce dynamic content changes, keeping users informed about actions such as resetting or synchronizing the input field. This improves user understanding and interaction with the application.

**Reset adornment**:

Use a reset button to return the `NumberInput` to its default value.

**Synchronize adornment**:

Synchronize the `NumberInput` with a live value from a constantly changing source, such as ticking stock values. The `NumberInput`'s value does not automatically update with changes in the live value. In this scenario, the synchronize button appears when the displayed value and live value differ.

**Custom buttons**:

Customize the positioning and appearance of `NumberInput`'s arrow buttons to align with specific product requirements or constraints.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="ButtonAdornments" />

## Disabled

The `NumberInput` can be disabled to prevent any user interaction or input.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Disabled" />

## Read-only

The `NumberInput` can be set to a read-only state using the `readOnly` prop, allowing users to highlight and copy the value without editing it.

By default, a dash ('-') serves as the empty marker. You can customize this marker by using the `emptyReadOnlyMarker` prop if your application needs a different symbol.

**Note:** To address browser and screen reader limitations in conveying a read-only state, the `NumberInput`'s role is changed to `textbox` when set to read-only.

### Best practices

Utilize the read-only state when users need to view the value for their workflow or current task but are not permitted to edit it, such as due to user permissions.

<LivePreview componentName="number-input" exampleName="Readonly" />

## Text alignment

To maintain a cohesive visual flow, numeric values are left-aligned by default, positioned directly beneath the label and other form field elements. If your specific use case or layout requires a different alignment, you can adjust the `NumberInput` to be right or center aligned using the `textAlign` prop.

### Best practices

- Right alignment is often used for numeric values to facilitate easier comparison. However, if number fields are mixed with text fields or do not relate to each other, left alignment may enhance the overall visual flow.
- Center alignment can be used to emphasize a particular value, but it should be applied sparingly and only in exceptional cases to avoid disrupting the visual consistency.
