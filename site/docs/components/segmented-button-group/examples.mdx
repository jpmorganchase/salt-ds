## Variants

Group buttons of the same variant to indicate that they are related.

Buttons within a single segmented button group should all be of the same variant.

See the [button docs](/salt/components/button/accessibility) on which variant to use.

<LivePreview componentName="segmented-button-group" exampleName="IconOnly">

## Icon Only

Avoid using icons that are very similar in the same segmented button group.

Use Tooltip on an icon-only button to describe the action, as per the [button guidance](/salt/components/button/examples#icon-only).
