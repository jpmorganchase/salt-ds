## Best practices

- When using SegmentedButtonGroup ensure you follow the [`button accessibility guidance`](/salt/components/button/accessibility)

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab moves focus to the first button in the SegmentedButtonGroup and then to the succeeding button.
- If the button is disabled and cannot receive focus, Tab moves focus to the next focusable button.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- This action moves focus to the last button in the SegmentedButtonGroup and then to previous button.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- If the button has focus, this action activates it.
- If the button is disabled and can receive focus, this action does nothing.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
