## Best practices

- When using segmented button group ensure you follow the [`button accessibility guidance`](/salt/components/button/accessibility)

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab moves focus to the segmented button group.
- If moving focus into a segmented button group, Tab moves focus to the first button in the group.
- If focus is inside a segmented button group, Tab moves focus to the next button in the group.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- If the button has focus, this action activates it.
- If the button is disabled and can receive focus, this action does nothing.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- This action moves focus to outside of the segmented button group component and to the previous element in the tabbing order.
- If focus is inside a segmented button group, this action moves focus to the previous button within the tab order.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
