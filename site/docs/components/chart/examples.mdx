## Line chart

Use a line chart to show changes in data over time.

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="LineChart" />

## Pie chart

Use a pie chart to show proportions of a whole.

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="PieChart" />

## Donut chart

Use a donut chart to show proportions of a whole, with space in the center to highlight key values or additional information.

A donut chart is a variation of the pie chart, with the `plotOptions.pie.innerSize` set to less than `100%` within the `Options` object.

### Best practices

- An `innerSize` value of `80%` is recommended for a good default visual balance.

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="DonutChart" />

## Column chart

Use a column chart to compare values across categories. Each category is represented by a single vertical bar.

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="ColumnChart" />

## Bar chart

Use a bar chart to compare values across categories. Bars are shown side-by-side for each series.

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="BarChart" />

## Stacked bar chart

Use a stacked bar chart to compare part-to-whole relationships across categories. Each bar shows the total, with segments representing series values.

A stacked bar chart is a variation of the bar chart, with the `plotOptions.series.stacking` set to `normal` within the `Options` object.

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="StackedBarChart" />

## Waterfall chart

Use a waterfall chart to show the cumulative effect of sequential positive and negative values. This is ideal for visualizing financial data, showing how an initial value is affected by a series of changes.

<Callout title="Note">
  To use the waterfall chart, import the Highcharts `highcharts-more` module and
  use it to wrap the `Highcharts` object as shown in the example.
</Callout>

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="WaterfallChart" />

## Candlestick chart

Use a candlestick chart to display price movements over time, showing open, high, low, and close values for each period. This chart type is commonly used for financial data visualization.

<Callout title="Note">
  To use the candlestick chart, import the Highcharts `stock` module and use it
  to wrap the `Highcharts` object as shown in the example.
</Callout>

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="CandlestickChart" />

## Bullet chart

Use a bullet chart to show performance against a target across categories. Each category displays a single bar with a marker indicating the target value.

<Callout title="Note">
  To use the bullet chart, ensure you import the Highcharts `bullet` module and
  use it to wrap the `Highcharts` object as shown in the example below.
</Callout>

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="BulletChart" />

## Box plot chart

Use a box plot chart to show the distribution of data across different categories, displaying minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values.

### Best practices

- A `pointWidth` value of `40px` is recommended for a good default visual balance.

<Callout title="Note">
  To use the box plot chart, ensure you import the Highcharts `highcharts-more`
  module and use it to wrap the `Highcharts` object as shown in the example
  below.
</Callout>

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="BoxPlotChart" />

## Area chart

Use an area chart to show trends over time and the contribution of categories to a total.

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="AreaChart" />

## Scatter chart

Use a scatter chart to show the relationship between two numerical variables. To ensure accessible presentation, fill patterns can be applied to the scatter points (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

The `axes-grid-lines` class name applied to the container enables both vertical and horizontal grid lines.

<LivePreview componentName="chart" exampleName="ScatterChart" />

## Bubble chart

Use a bubble chart to show the relationship between two variables, with a third variable represented by the size of each bubble. This is helpful for visualizing clusters and outliers across categories. To ensure the presentation is accessible, fill patterns can be applied to the chart (see [Patterns and Fills](./usage#patterns-and-fills) for details).

The `axes-grid-lines` class name applied to the container enables both vertical and horizontal grid lines.

<Callout title="Note">
  To use the bubble chart, import the Highcharts `highcharts-more` module and
  use it to wrap the `Highcharts` object as shown in the example.
</Callout>
