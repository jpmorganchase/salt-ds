    `Chart` is a visually rich way to represent datasets, built on the [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) library to support a wide range of graph types and accessibility features while leveraging well-documented APIs for flexible integration and customization.

    To ensure visual consistency, it utilizes the Salt-styled package to provide CSS-based styles and configuration options for non-CSS styles.
