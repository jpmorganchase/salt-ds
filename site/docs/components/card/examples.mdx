    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Default" displayName="Card" >
      ### Card

      By default, the basic Card component does not have any interactive or focusable elements within it. 
    </LivePreview>


    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Accent" >
      ### Accent

    - Use the ‘accent’ prop to place the accent bar at the top, right, bottom or left of any card.
    - The accent is consistently used for Link Cards and Interactable Cards to indicate interaction capability.
    - When applying an accent to a basic Card component, use the ‘hoverable’ prop to enable a hover effect when needed.
    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Actions" >
      ### Actions

    Use the basic Card to incorporate actions like links or buttons within it. Avoid embedding actions directly into a Link card or an Interactable card.
    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Variants" >
      ### Variants

      All card components provide both primary and secondary variants, offering flexibility and enabling differentiation based on visual hierarchy within your UI.

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="InteractableCard" >
      ### Interactable card

      - Use the `InteractableCard` component to make the entire card interactable. Don't use any focusable elements within interactable cards.
      - To use as a link, wrap `Card` in [`Link`](../link).
      - Avoid adding too much content to interactable cards. All users should be able to read them easily, and it shouldn't take too long for a screen reader tool to read out the content.

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="SecondaryInteractableCard" >
      ### Secondary Interactable Card
    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="DisabledInteractableCard" >
      ### Disabled interactable card
      - Set `disabled={true}` to apply disabled styling to interactable cards.
      - Make sure to also apply `disabled={true}` to any nested components, such as `Text`, to ensure disabled styling also applies to the content.
    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="MultipleCards" >
      ### Multiple cards
      You can use layout components to group card components together.
