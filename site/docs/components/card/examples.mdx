<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Default" displayName="Card" >
## Card

By default, the card component does not have any interactive or focusable elements.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Variants" >
## Variants

All card components provide both primary and secondary variants, offering flexibility and enabling differentiation based on visual hierarchy within your UI.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Accents" >
## Accents

- The accent in a card is optional, but you can use it to indicate meaning (such as product or brand color).
- When paired with the hoverable prop, an accent can indicate a card is interactive when the user moves focus to the card. Interactable cards and link cards are always hoverable.
- Maintain consistency in accent placement across cards to ensure a coherent visual experience in your UI.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Actions" >
## Actions

You can incorporate actions like [links](../link) or [buttons](../button) into a card. Don't embed actions into a link card or an interactable card, as the card itself is the interactive element.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="LinkCardExample" displayName="Link Card 🚧">
## Link card

- Use a link card when the entire card is clickable and navigates the user within the same tab or to a new tab.
- Don't use any focusable elements within link cards, only use static content such as text or icons.
- Avoid adding too much content to link cards. Users should be able to read them easily, and it shouldn't take too long for a screen reader tool to read out the content.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="FullWidthImage" >
## Full width image

When using images in cards, set the image to span the card's entire width. You can do this by setting `--saltCard-padding: 0` and putting padding around any content below the image.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="CustomPadding" >
## Custom padding

- By default, the card components include `--salt-spacing-200` inner padding.
- For very small cards with a limited hit area, customizing the padding to `--salt-spacing-100` is advisable.
- When your cards are intended to occupy a significant portion of your application window, `--salt-spacing-300` is recommended.
- Customize the spacing using the `--saltCard-padding` or `--saltLinkCard-padding` CSS properties.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="CustomAccent" >
## Custom accent

- By default, the card components accent color uses `--salt-container-primary-borderColor` or `--salt-container-secondary-borderColor` depending on the variant.
- When there is a need to associate a brand or product color to the accent bar, you can override `--saltCard-accent-color` or `--saltLinkCard-accent-color` with the desired color.

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="InteractableCardExample" displayName="Interactable Card">
      ### Interactable card

    - Use an Interactable card when the entire card functions as a button, or when the entire card needs to be selectable from a group of cards.
    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="DisabledInteractableCard" >
      ### Disabled interactable card

    - The Interactable card component can be disabled to prevent the user from interacting with it, i.e. if the option is temporarily unavailable
    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="ToggleGroup" >
      ### Toggle group

    - Interactable cards can be used as a toggle button. They are typically used within a group context, facilitating single or multi selection.
    </LivePreview>

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="DisabledToggleGroup" >
      ### Disabled toggle group

    - Set both disabled={true} and selected={true} to apply selected-disabled styling to interactable cards.
    - Make sure to also apply disabled={true} and selected={true} to any nested components, such as Text, to ensure selected-disabled styling also applies to the content.
