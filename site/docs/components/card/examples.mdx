    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Accents" >
      ### Accents

    - The accent in a Card is optional, however, it can be used to indicate meaning (such as Product or Brand color).
    - An accent can work well with the hoverable prop, to indicate it is interactive when the user's focus is over a specific card.
    - The accent ensures the WCAG 2.1 min-contrast requirement of interactive components is met.
    - Maintain consistency in accent placement across cards to ensure a coherent visual experience in your UI.

        <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="FullWidthImage" >
      ### Full width image

      - When using images within your card components, we recommend having the image span the entire width of the card.
      - You can achieve this by setting `--saltCard-padding: 0` and putting padding around any content below the image.

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="CustomPadding" >
      ### Custom padding

      - By default, the card components include spacing-200 inner padding.
      - For very small cards with a limited hit area, customizing the padding to spacing-100 is advisable.
      - When your cards are intended to occupy a significant portion of your application window, spacing-300 is recommended.
      - Customize the spacing using the `--saltCard-padding` CSS property.

        <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="CustomAccent" >
      ### Custom accent

      - By default, the card components accent color uses the Salt --container-border tokens in both primary and secondary variants.
      - When there is a need to associate a brand or product color to the accent bar, you can override `--saltCard-accentColor` to achieve your application needs.
