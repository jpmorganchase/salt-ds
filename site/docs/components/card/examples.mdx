<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Accents" >
### Accents

- The accent in a card is optional, but you can use it to indicate meaning (such as product or brand color).
- When paired with the hoverable prop, an accent can indicate a card is interactive when the user moves focus to the card.
- Maintain consistency in accent placement across cards to ensure a coherent visual experience in your UI.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Actions" >
### Actions

You can incorporate actions like [links](../link) or [buttons](../button) into a card. Don't embed actions into a link card or an interactable card, as the card itself is the interactive element.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="FullWidthImage" >
### Full width image

When using images in cards, set the image to span the card's entire width. You can do this by setting `--saltCard-padding: 0` and putting padding around any content below the image.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="CustomPadding" >
### Custom padding

- By default, the card components include `--salt-spacing-200` inner padding.
- For very small cards with a limited hit area, customizing the padding to `--salt-spacing-100` is advisable.
- When your cards are intended to occupy a significant portion of your application window, `--salt-spacing-300` is recommended.
- Customize the spacing using the `--saltCard-padding` CSS property.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="CustomAccent" >
### Custom accent

- By default, the card components accent color uses `--salt-container-primary-borderColor` or `--salt-container-secondary-borderColor` depending on the variant.
