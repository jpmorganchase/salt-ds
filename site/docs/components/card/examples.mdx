## Card

By default, the card component does not have any interactive or focusable elements.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Default" />

## Variants

Cards are available in several variants: primary, secondary, and tertiary, with an additional ghost variant for static cards. These variants can be combined to create different levels of hierarchy within your UI. There is no strict order to follow; the choice largely depends on the content, layout, and structure of your UI. Select the variant that best aligns with the design language you are establishing and the hierarchy you aim to create.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Variants" />

Ghost cards can create a seamless integration with the surrounding elements, making the layout feel more fluid and less compartmentalized. This can be useful in designs where a continuous flow of information is desired. For example, if you want to highlight particular content over the top of a custom background, image or gradient.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Ghost" />

## Accents

- The accent in a card is optional, but you can use it to indicate meaning (such as product or brand color).
- When paired with the hoverable prop, an accent can indicate a card is interactive when the user moves focus to the card. Interactable cards and link cards are always hoverable.
- Maintain consistency in accent placement across cards to ensure a coherent visual experience in your UI.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Accents" />

## Actions

You can incorporate actions like [links](../link) or [buttons](../button) into a card. Don't embed actions into a link card or an interactable card, as the card itself is the interactive element.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Actions" />

## Link card

- Use a link card when the entire card is clickable and navigates the user within the same tab or to a new tab.
- Don't use any focusable elements within link cards, only use static content such as text or icons.
- Avoid adding too much content to link cards. Users should be able to read them easily, and it shouldn't take too long for a screen reader tool to read out the content.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="LinkCardExample" />

## Full width image

When using images in cards, set the image to span the card's entire width. You can do this by setting `--saltCard-padding: 0` and putting padding around any content below the image.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="FullWidthImage" />

## Image as background

You can set an image as the background of a card using [`background-image`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image) in CSS. Ensure there is enough contrast between the color of the text and the colors of the background image. [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html) recommends a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for regular text and 3:1 for larger text.

## Custom padding

- By default, the card components include `--salt-spacing-200` inner padding.
- For very small cards with a limited hit area, customizing the padding to `--salt-spacing-100` is advisable.
- When your cards are intended to occupy a significant portion of your application window, `--salt-spacing-300` is recommended.
- Customize the spacing using the `--saltCard-padding` or `--saltLinkCard-padding` CSS properties.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="CustomPadding" />

## Custom accent

- By default, the card components accent color uses `--salt-container-primary-borderColor` or `--salt-container-secondary-borderColor` depending on the variant.
- When there is a need to associate a brand or product color to the accent bar, you can override `--saltCard-accent-color` or `--saltLinkCard-accent-color` with the desired color.

## Interactable card

Use an Interactable card when the entire card functions as a button, or when the entire card needs to be selectable from a group of cards.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="InteractableCardExample" />

## Disabled interactable card

The Interactable card component can be disabled to prevent the user from interacting with it, e.g., if the option is temporarily unavailable

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="DisabledInteractableCard" />

## Toggle group

Interactable cards can be used as a toggle button. This would typically be when used within a group context, facilitating single or multi selection.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="ToggleGroup" />

## Disabled toggle group

- Set both `disabled={true}` and `selected={true}` to apply selected-disabled styling to interactable cards.
- Make sure to also apply `disabled={true}` and `selected={true}` to any nested components, such as Text, to ensure selected-disabled styling also applies to the content.

<LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="DisabledToggleGroup" />
