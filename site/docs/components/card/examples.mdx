    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Default" displayName="Card" >
      ### Card

      By default, the Card component does not have any interactive or focusable elements within it. 
    </LivePreview>

        <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Variants" >
      ### Variants

      All card components provide both primary and secondary variants, offering flexibility and enabling differentiation based on visual hierarchy within your UI.

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Accents" >
      ### Accents

    - Use the ‘accent’ prop to place the accent bar at the top, right, bottom or left of any card.
    - The accent in a Card is optional, however, it can be used to indicate meaning (such as Product or Brand color).
    - An accent can work well with the hoverable prop, to afford the color when the user's focus is over a specific card.
    - In contrast, an accent is always visible in Link Cards and Interactable Cards to indicate their interaction capability. The accent ensures the WCAG 2.1 min-contrast requirement of interactive components is met.
    - Maintain consistency in accent placement across cards to ensure a coherent visual experience in your UI.

    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="Actions" >
      ### Actions

    Use the Card to incorporate actions like [Links](../link) or [Buttons](../button). Avoid embedding actions directly into an Interactable Card component.

        <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="FullWidthImage" >
      ### Full width image

      - When using images within your card components, we recommend having the image span the entire width of the card.
      - You can achieve this by setting `--saltCard-padding: 0` and putting padding around any content below the image.
    </LivePreview>


    <LivePreview componentName="card" exampleName="CustomPadding" >
      ### Custom padding

      - By default, the card components include spacing-200 inner padding.
      - For very small cards with a limited hit area, customizing the padding to spacing-100 is advisable.
      - When your cards are intended to occupy a significant portion of your application window, spacing-300 is recommended.
      - Customize the spacing using the `--saltCard-padding` CSS property.
