In adherence to accessibility standards, the boundaries of a user interface component are only subjective to the 3:1 contrast minimum if they serve to identify the components purpose.

Salt card components incorporate subtle borders as part of their design. To ensure these cards meet accessibility criteria, itâ€™s imperative to check that any content (i.e., text or icon) used within them maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4:5:1 against the card background. This can be achieved by using the `--salt-content-*` tokens.

For optimal accessibility when using multiple cards together:

- Use cards of uniform size.
- Use a repetitive arrangement pattern.
- Maintain consistent spacing between the cards.
- Use `InteractableCardGroup` to ensure users can navigate between interactable cards using keyboard controls, similar to interacting with checkboxes and radio buttons.

Salt provides layout components that can help achieve this.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- Tab moves focus to a link card or an interactable card.
- In a single-select group, moves focus to the next focusable element on the page. This is consistent with radio button.
- In a multi-select group, moves focus to the next card within the group. This is consistent with checkbox.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- Tab moves focus to a link card or an interactable card.
- In a single-select group, moves focus to the previous focusable element on the page.
- In a multi-select group, moves focus to the previous card within the group.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Space">

- In a single-select group, selects an unselected interactable card.
- In a multi-select group, selects or deselects an interactable card.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter">

- In a link card, Enter navigates the user.
- In an interactable card outside of a group, if the card has focus Enter activates it.

</KeyboardControl>

<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Up arrow / Down arrow / Left arrow / Right arrow">

- In a single-select group, moves focus between the available card options, and simultaneously selects an option.

</KeyboardControl>
