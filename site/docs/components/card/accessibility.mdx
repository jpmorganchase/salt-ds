In adherence to accessibility standards, the boundaries of a user interface component are only subjective to the 3:1 contrast minimum if they serve to identify the components purpose.

Salt Card components incorporate subtle borders as part of their design. To ensure these Cards meet accessibility criteria, it’s imperative to check that any content (i.e., text or icon) used within them maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4:5:1 against the Card background. This can be achieved by using the Salt --content tokens.

For optimal accessibility when using multiple Cards together, we recommend to:
Utilise Cards of uniform size
Use a repetitive arrangement pattern 
Maintain consistent spacing between the Cards

Salt provides layout components that can help achieve this.
