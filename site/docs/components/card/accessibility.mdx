In adherence to accessibility standards, the boundaries of a user interface component are only subjective to the 3:1 contrast minimum if they serve to identify the components purpose.

Salt card components incorporate subtle borders as part of their design. To ensure these cards meet accessibility criteria, itâ€™s imperative to check that any content (i.e., text or icon) used within them maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4:5:1 against the card background. This can be achieved by using the `--salt-content-*` tokens.

For optimal accessibility when using multiple cards together:

- Use cards of uniform size.
- Use a repetitive arrangement pattern.
- Maintain consistent spacing between the cards.

Salt provides layout components that can help achieve this.
