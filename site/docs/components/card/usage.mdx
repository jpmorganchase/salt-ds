### When to use Card

- To group related information with the same visual hierarchy.
- To present a summary of a larger idea.
- To link to more detailed information.

### When not to use Card

- To display sequential information or emphasize ranking. Consider [List](../list) instead.
- As a stand-alone call to action. Consider [Button](../button) instead.
- For decoration purposes only.

### Card groups

- Group cards together in a layout using similar size and content length. If the content and size differs among Cards, consider layout customisation. (i.e. Mosaic grid).
- Avoid repeating images or content in a group of Cards.
- Use the same accent placement in a group if interactable.

### Interactable elements

A default Card can contain any UI elements, such as actionable components like [Buttons](../button) or [Links](../link). You can use this, for example, to link to more detailed information.

Interactable Cards should not contain actionable components ([Buttons](../button) or [Links](../link)) because the card itself is the interactive element.

### Import

To import Card from the core Salt package, use:

```
import { Card, InteractableCard } from "@salt-ds/core";
```
