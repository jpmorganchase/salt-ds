### Using the components

#### When to use

- To group related information with the same visual hierarchy.
- To present a summary of a larger idea.
- To link to more detailed information.

#### When not to use

- To display sequential information or emphasize ranking. Instead, use [`List`](../list).
- As a stand-alone call to action. Instead, use [`Button`](../button).
- For decoration purposes only.

### Card groups

- Group cards together in a layout using similar size and content length. If the content and size differs among cards, consider layout customization such as a Mosaic grid.
- Avoid repeating images or content in a group of cards.
- Use the same accent placement in a group if interactable.

### Interactable elements

A default card can contain any UI elements, including actionable components such as [buttons](../button) or [links](../link). You can use these, for example, to link to more detailed information.

Interactable cards shouldn't contain actionable components (like [Buttons](../button) or [Links](../link)), as the card itself is the interactive element.
