### When to use Card

- To group related information with the same visual hierarchy.
- To present a summary of a larger idea.
- To link to more detailed information.

### When not to use Card

- To display sequential information or emphasize ranking. Consider [List](../list) instead.
- As a stand-alone call to action. Consider [Button](../button) instead.
- For decoration purposes only.

### Card groups

- Group cards together in a layout using similar size and content length. If the content and size differs among Cards, consider layout customisation. (i.e. Mosaic grid).
- Avoid repeating images or content in a group of Cards.
- Use the same accent placement in a group if interactable.

### Interactable elements

A default Card can contain any UI elements, such as actionable components like Buttons or Links. You can use this, for example, to link to more detailed information.

Interactable Cards should not contain actionable components (Buttons or Links) because the card itself is the interactive element.

### Import

To import Card from the core Salt package, use:

```
import { Card, InteractableCard } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

#### Card Props

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Card" />
