### Using the Card component

#### When to use Card

- To group related information with the same visual hierarchy.
- To present a summary of a larger idea.
- To link to more detailed information.

#### When not to use Card

- To display sequential information or emphasize ranking. Consider List instead.
- As a stand-alone call to action. Consider Button instead.
- For decoration purposes only.

#### Card groups

- Group cards together in a layout using similar size and content length. If the content and size differs among Cards, consider layout customizatoin. (i.e. Mosaic grid).
- Avoid repeating images or content in a group of Cards.
- Use the same accent placement in a group if interactable.
