## Default

By default, `Accordion` is a single element the user can expand or collapse to show or hide content within a panel.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="accordion" exampleName="Group">

## Accordion group

You can place accordions in an accordion group, which allows multiple accordions to be open at the same time.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="accordion" exampleName="ExclusiveGroup">

## Exclusive group

You can use `Accordion`'s controlled API to allow only one accordion to be expanded at a time.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="accordion" exampleName="Disabled" >

## Disabled

Use the `disabled` prop to disable an accordion. The user can't expand, collapse or focus a disabled accordion.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="accordion" exampleName="IndicatorSide" >

## Indicator side

Use the `indicatorSide` prop to customise which side the indicator is displayed in accordion header.

The chevron indicator icon in the Accordion header can be displayed on the right-hand side by setting the `indicatorSide` prop to `right`.
_Note that the content left aligns to the text in accordion header, so moving the indicator to the right side will also change the content's left padding._

Positioning the indicator icon on the right side may be suitable if you are:

- Using descriptive icons consistently next to accordion labels.
- Building mobile experiences, where the chevron is often displayed within (right-hand) thumb reach.
- Implementing a drag-and-drop reorder behaviour, and building a drag handle into the left side of each Accordion.

The right position should be avoided:

- In exceptionally wide accordions for accessibility to ensure the chevron is visible next to the label on browser zoom.
- Where there is heavy use of form fields, to clearly distinguish the accordion from surrounding fields and clearly identify form sections.

The indicator icon is positioned on the far right of the accordion. Additional elements, such as a secondary label or validation icons (error, warning, success), will be positioned between the accordion label and the chevron icon.

<LivePreview componentName="accordion" exampleName="Status" >

## Status

You can set a status of "error", "warning" or "success" for an accordion to indicate the type of content it contains.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="accordion" exampleName="InlineBadge" >

## Inline badge

You can use an inline [badge](../badge) to indicate a change, or several changes, to the content within the accordion.

</LivePreview>
<LivePreview componentName="accordion" exampleName="AdditionalLabels" >

## Additional labels

You can add additional labels to provide extra context using the [`Text`](../text) and [`Stack Layout`](../stack-layout) components.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="accordion" exampleName="ExpandAll" >

## Expand all

You can use Accordion's controlled API to implement custom behaviour e.g. expand/collapse all.
