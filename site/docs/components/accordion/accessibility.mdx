## Best practices

- For assistive technologies, the visible label on a control usually acts as the accessible name.
  - If modifying the accessible name, the accordion's accessible name must include the visible name (the label).
- Within a group of accordion headers, all headers should be the same heading level.
  - Ensure heading levels align with the overall page hierarchy.
- Avoid nested accordions.
  - Don't put an accordion in another accordion.

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">

- If focus is above the accordion group, Tab moves focus to the first accordion item in the group. Then, each press moves to the next accordion item.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Shift + Tab">

- If focus is below the accordion group, this action moves focus to the last accordion item in the group. Then, each press moves focus to the previous accordion item in the group.

</KeyboardControl>
<KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Enter / Space">

- Accordions are in the collapsed state by default. This action expands, or collapses, accordions.

</KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>

## Known Issue

- VoiceOver/Safari on Mac bug: VoiceOver doesn't report state changes dynamically for Accordion buttons. **(This isn't a Salt bug)**
  - Only workaround is to tab away and shift+tab back to this control then it will announce the state.
  - This is reproducible in the [APG accordion example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion/) as well.
