## Best practices

When building a page layout, apply semantic HTML. This means using the correct HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible.

The `BorderLayout` and `BorderItem` components support this behavior by allowing access to a prop called `as` that allows you to render the appropriate HTML instead of a plain `div`.

```tsx
<BorderItem position="north" as="nav">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="#">Link</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">Link</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="#">Link</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</BorderItem>
```
