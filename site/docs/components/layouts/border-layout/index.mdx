title: Border layout
data:
  description: "Border Layout manages the top-level layout of your application, website or widget, to position elements, such as a footer, header or side navigation, around the main content area. `BorderLayout` builds on top of `GridLayout` to define five distinct regions, with four surrounding a main content region. It's best to use it for entire website pages or application screens, where there's at least one additional region alongside the main area."
