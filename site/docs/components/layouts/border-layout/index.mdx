title: Border layout
data:
  description: "`BorderLayout` manages the top-level arrangement of your application, website or widget by positioning elements such as a footer, header and side navigation around the main content area. `BorderLayout` builds on top of `GridLayout`, defining five distinct regions, of which four surround the main content region. This layout is best for entire website pages or application screens with at least one additional region alongside the main area."
