title: Flow layout
data:
  description: "`FlowLayout` is a simple mechanism that arranges UI elements in a horizontal order and responsively wraps them onto subsequent rows. It builds on top of `FlexLayout` and is best for small-scale layouts to display components in a responsive row, such as a row of metrics or a filter bar where fields wrap over multiple lines. For additional control of the size and position of content, use `FlexItem` for each content item inside a `FlowLayout`."
