title: Flex layout
data:
  description: "Flex Layout enables complex arrangement of UI elements within a container, enabling responsive design by controlling the alignment, direction and size of items, for example, use it to arrange a items in a row, evenly spaced and centered vertically. Use when the direction needs complex customization that can't be achieved by `StackLayout`, `FlowLayout` or `SplitLayout`. For additional control of the size and position of content, use `FlexItem` for each content item inside `FlexLayout`."
