  description: "`FlexLayout` enables complex arrangement of UI elements within a container and facilitates responsive design by controlling the alignment, direction and size of items. Use it to arrange items in a row, evenly spaced and centered vertically, or to implement customized direction more complex than `StackLayout`, `FlowLayout` or `SplitLayout`. For additional control of the size and position of content, use `FlexItem` for each content item within `FlexLayout`."
