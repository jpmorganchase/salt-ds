title: Parent-child layout
data:
  description: "Parent-child Layout provides a parent content area alongside a dependent child content area and responsively stacks them at a given breakpoint. It is typically used for master-detail interactions, where selection in the parent (master) determines detail displayed in the child, such as navigation for a preferences dialog."
