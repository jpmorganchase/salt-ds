## Using the component

### When to use

- To organize content into two areas: a larger area, and a smaller area that controls the larger area.

### When not to use

- To position more than two layout items along a single dimension. Instead, use [`FlexLayout`](../flex-layout), [`FlowLayout`](../flow-layout), [`StackLayout`](../stack-layout) or [`SplitLayout`](../split-layout) depending on how you want to position them.
- To position more than two layout items in a grid. Instead, use [`GridLayout`](../grid-layout).
