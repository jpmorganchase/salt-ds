## Using the component

### When to use

- If you need two defined areas at the opposite horizontal ends of a container, for example, if you need two button bar components in a header.

### When not to use

- If your layout requires more than two regions. Instead, use [`FlowLayout`](../flow-layout).
- If you want more complex customization in your layout, consider [`FlexLayout`](../flex-layout).
