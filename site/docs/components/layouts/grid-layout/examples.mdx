## Default

`GridLayout` defaults to a 12-column grid with one row.

Content in `GridLayout` is inside `GridItem` components. This helps control the size and position of content.

### Best practices

- We recommend `GridItem` components for displaying content in the layout. If the layout is very simple (i.e., doesn't span multiple columns or rows), you can place content (e.g., components, text, divs, etc) directly into the `GridLayout` component.
- Any items displayed beyond 12 columns (or the number of defined columns) will wrap to a subsequent row.
- Use `columnGap` and `rowGap` properties to set a specific gap in a particular dimension or `gap` to update both values simultaneously.

## Columns and rows

Use grid layout `column` and `row` properties to control the number of columns and rows in the layout.

## Responsive layout

The grid layout’s responsive properties allow you to customize specific properties of the grid (such as the number of columns and rows) per breakpoint.

You can use the default [Salt breakpoints](/salt/foundations/responsiveness/breakpoints) or pass in your own using [`SaltProvider`](/salt/components/salt-provider).

A responsive property is a property that takes either multiple values (one value per breakpoint) or a single value that would take effect across all different screen sizes. An example is a layout that will responsively change from 12 columns to two and then to one as the space decreases:

```js
columns={{ xs: 1, sm: 2, lg: 12, md: 12, xl: 12 }}
```

### Best practices

- Use the grid layout’s responsive properties when the flow of the grid is dependent on the viewport size, such as when a user typically resizes their application or webpage and content needs to remain visible.
- Define specific layout behaviors per breakpoint to optimize the content display across different device sizes.

## Spanning columns and rows

Although it is possible to use `GridLayout` without using `GridItem`, we strongly recommend that you wrap items with the `GridItem` component. Using a grid item, you can control the size and position of content in the grid. By default, a grid item will span one column and one row. Use the `colSpan` and `rowSpan` props to increase the size of individual items to span multiple rows and columns.

### Best practices

Spanning multiple columns and rows is an effective way to drive visual hierarchy in the layout. For example, grid items at the top of an analytical dashboard are typically larger in size to emphasize data visualizations, such as charts or metrics.

## Expanding and collapsing items

Use the `colSpan` and `rowSpan` props to dynamically control the size of an item in the grid to show more or less content to the user. This example shows how to expand a grid item in the layout and reposition surrounding grid items at the same time.

  componentName="grid-layout"
  exampleName="ExpandingAndCollapsingItems"
/>

## Positioning items

Use the `verticalAlignment` and `horizontalAlignment` props to control the position of content in the grid layout.

<LivePreview componentName="grid-layout" exampleName="PositioningItems" />

## Custom columns and rows

The `columns` and `rows` props allow you to pass a string to define a column or row template.

<LivePreview componentName="grid-layout" exampleName="CustomColumnsAndRows" />

## Spacing

Grid layout displays items with a gap between items that is a multiple of the [Salt base unit](/salt/foundations/spacing) controlled by the `gap`, `columnGap` and `rowGap` properties and is by default set to 3.
The spacing properties `padding` and `margin` are set to 0 by default and can be used to control the layout's inner and outer spacing (also as multiples of the Salt base unit).
