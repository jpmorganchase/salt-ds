title: Grid layout
data:
  description: "Grid Layout enables complex arrangement of UI elements within a system of columns and rows to create an evenly distributed, responsive and organized user interface. It is typically used to position repeating widgets in the main content area, such as a Dashboard. When combined with responsive breakpoints, you can configure `GridLayout` and `GridItem` to determine how its content is displayed across different viewport sizes or device screen sizes, for example, how many columns wide the UI element should be."
