title: Grid layout
data:
  description: "`GridLayout` enables complex arrangement of UI elements within a system of columns and rows to create an evenly distributed, responsive and organized user interface. Use it to position repeating widgets in the main content area, such as in a Dashboard. When combined with responsive breakpoints, you can configure `GridLayout` and `GridItem` to determine how content is displayed across different viewports and screen sizes."
