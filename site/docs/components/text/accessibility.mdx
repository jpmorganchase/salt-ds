### Best practices

We're letting you decide on the user experience you'd like to implement for text. However, you need to remain ADA compliant and provide the correct visual and auditory experience for text truncation. Truncated text must comply with [WCAG SC 1.4.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/resize-text.html).

The requirement states you must make any visually rendered text accessible and display it in full. You must ensure that users can view truncated strings in full if they wish. Consider using tooltips as a mechanism for expanding the text or a link to open the full content on a new page.

If you use truncated text, you must ensure that a screen reader can read the full value.
