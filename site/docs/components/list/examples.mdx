### Single-select List

The default List allows a user to make a single selection from the options available.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="list" exampleName="Disabled">

### Disabled List

If the options within the List are not applicable or relevant to the current user, the List can be presented as disabled.

The user retains the ability to scroll through the List items but can’t make a selection. If a List item has already been selected, for instance as a default selection, it will be displayed as such, the user can view it but can’t change the state.
