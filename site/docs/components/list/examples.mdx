## Single-select list

The default list allows a user to make a single selection from the options available.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="list" exampleName="Disabled">

## Disabled list

If the options within the list aren't applicable or relevant to the current user, you can present the list as disabled.

The user retains the ability to scroll through the list items but can’t make a selection. If a list already has an item selected, for instance, as a default selection, it will display as such; the user can view it but can’t change the state.
