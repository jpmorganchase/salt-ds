<LivePreview componentName="component-name" exampleName="ComponentExample" title="Single select">

<LivePreview componentName="component-name" exampleName="ComponentExample" title="Deselectable">

Use the deselectable variant if users will need to be able to deselect items in a single-select List. To enable this behavior, set the `deselectable` prop to true

<LivePreview componentName="component-name" exampleName="ComponentExample" title="Configurable list height">

If the List height is greater than the available space, it becomes vertically scrollable. You can control its height by using `displayedItemCount` to configure the number of items displayedâ€”and the List height will automatically adjust. We recommend this method of setting your List height, as it ensures that all items are displayed in their entirety and not partially clipped.

<LivePreview componentName="component-name" exampleName="ComponentExample" title="Borderless">
