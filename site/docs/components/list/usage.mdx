## Using the components

### When to use

- To present a set of selectable options that allow users to make a choice for an onward action, such as filtering a data grid, selecting a country or assigning a task.

### When not to use

- If the list items provide navigation, consider using stacked [`NavigationItem`s](../navigation-item) to form a vertical navigation pattern.
- If the list is likely to contain five items or fewer, consider using [`RadioButtonGroup`](../radio-button).
- If the list is likely to contain between five and 10 items and doesn't need to be visible at all times, consider placing the list of items within [`Dropdown`](../dropdown).
- If the List contains more than 10 items and you have limited screen space, consider using a [`ComboBox`](../combo-box).
