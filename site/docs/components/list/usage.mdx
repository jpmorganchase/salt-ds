### Using the List component

#### When to use List

- To present a set of selectable options that allow users to define choices for an onward action, such as filtering a data grid, selecting a country, or assigning a task.

#### When not to use List

- If the List items are intended to provide navigation, consider using stacked [Navigation Items](/salt/components/navigation-item) to form a vertical navigation pattern.
- If the List is likely to contain five items or fewer, consider using a [Radio Button Group](/salt/components/radio-button).
- If the List is likely to contain between five and 10 items and does not need to be visible at all times, consider placing the list of items within a [Dropdown](/salt/components/dropdown).
- If the List contains more than 10 items and screen space is limited, consider using a [Combo Box](/salt/components/combobox).
