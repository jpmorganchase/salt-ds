### Using the List component

#### When to use List

- To present a set of selectable options.
- To define attributes for an onward action such as filtering a data grid, grouping reports or selecting templates.
- To organize selectable options into groups. [TODO: do we remove this for now as we donâ€™t have Grouped List feature?]

#### When not to use List

- To provide navigation within an application. Use vertical navigation instead.
- To navigate options with hierarchical parent-child relationship. Instead, use components that suit your needs such as: tree, cascading menu, or menu button.
- To execute commands, or trigger the display of modal windows or dialog boxes.
- To select among a small number of options. Consider checkbox or radio button instead.
