### Using the List component

- Use a List to present a set of selectable options that allow users to define choices for an onward action, for instance filtering a data grid, selecting a country, or assigning a task.

#### When not to use List

- If the List items are intended to provide navigation consider using stacked navigation items to form a vertical navigation pattern.
- If the List is likely to contain five items or fewer consider using a [radio button group](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/radio-button).
- If the List is likely to contain between five and ten items and does not need to be visible at all times, consider placing the list of items within a [Dropdown](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/dropdown).
- If the List contains more than ten items and screen space is limited, consider using a [Combobox]((https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/combobox).

### Import
