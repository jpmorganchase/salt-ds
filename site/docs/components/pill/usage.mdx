### Using the Component Name component

#### When to use Pill

- Organize content that may be mapped to more than one category. This provides users with a way of distinguishing different types of content and categories.
- Trigger an immediate action—such as changing the view of content that’s currently on display or navigating to a new page.
- Enable an action that’s subject to change. Actions that may change depending on the context, and are not fixed, are better represented by Pill than Button. In a messaging application, for example, Pills can be used to display quick stock responses that change so they’re appropriate responses to received messages.

#### When not to use Pill

- When the content is a system message and cannot be interacted with. Use Badge instead.

### Import

{/* Update the text and code snippet below as needed: */}

To import Pill from the core Salt package, use:

```js
import { Pill } from "@salt-ds/core";
```

### Props

{/* Update packageName and componentName below as needed */}
{/* packageName is optional and defaults to "core" if omitted */}

<PropsTable packageName="core" componentName="Pill" />

### Content

Use title or sentence case when labelling a Pill. This maintains a visual distinction between Pills and Buttons, which always have uppercase labels.

Position any Pill you’re using to tag content below or on the right of the related content, so that it’s not the primary focus.

Never apply RAG (status) colors to the Pill component to differentiate between categories. Use an Icon instead.
