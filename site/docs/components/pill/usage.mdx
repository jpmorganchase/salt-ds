### Using the Pill component

- Use title or sentence case when labelling a Pill. This maintains a visual distinction between Pills and Buttons, which always have uppercase labels.

- Position any Pill you’re using to tag content below or on the right of the related content, so that it’s not the primary focus.

- Never apply RAG (status) colors to the Pill component to differentiate between categories. Use Icon instead.

### Import

To import Pill from the lab Salt package, use:

```
import { PillNext } from “@salt-ds/lab”;
```
