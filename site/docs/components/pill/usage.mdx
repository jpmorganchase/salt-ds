## Using the component

### When to use

- To organize selections that don’t necessarily belong to the same category or need to be arranged in a certain way.
- To trigger an immediate action—such as filtering a view of content by a specific property or going to a new page contextually related to the pill.
- To enable an action that could change depending on the context. In a messaging application, you could use pills to display predefined replies that change depending on the received message.

### When not to use

- To organize selections belonging to the same category in a clear hierarchical way. Instead, use [Checkbox](/salt/components/checkbox).
- To switch between views (e.g., Grid view vs. Card view). Instead, use [ToggleButton](/salt/components/toggle-button).
- For binary actions that take effect immediately. Instead, use [Switch](/salt/components/switch).
- For actions that do not dynamically change with the context. Instead, use [Button](/salt/components/button).
- For labeling. Instead, use [Tag](/salt/components/tag).

## Content

- Content should be succinct, often one or a couple of words. Avoid using sentences.
- Keep pill labels as simple as possible, given the limited space
- Use title or sentence case when labeling pills. This maintains a visual distinction between Pill and Button, which always has uppercase labels.
