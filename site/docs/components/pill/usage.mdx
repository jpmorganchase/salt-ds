### Using the Pill component

Use title or sentence case when labelling a Pill. This maintains a visual distinction between Pills and Buttons, which always have uppercase labels.

Position any Pill you’re using to tag content below or on the right of the related content, so that it’s not the primary focus.

Never apply RAG (status) colors to the Pill component to differentiate between categories. Use [Icons](/salt/components/icon) or text instead.

#### When to use Pill

- To organize content that may be mapped to more than one category. This provides users with a way of distinguishing different types of content and categories.

- To trigger an immediate action—such as changing the view of content that’s currently on display or navigating to a new page that is contextually related to the pill.

- To enable an action that may change depending on the context. In a messaging application, you could use Pills to display predefined replies that change depending on the received message.

#### When not to use Pill

- Actions that may change depending on the context, and are not fixed, are better represented by Button than Pill.

- When the content is a system message and cannot be interacted with. Use [Badge](/salt/components/badge) instead.
