    ### Default

    You'll typically use the default pill for tagging purposes or to filter or change the page view. You can also use pills to trigger an action subject to change as a result of user input or a change in context, such as an autogenerated quick response to a message.

  <LivePreview componentName="pill" exampleName="Closable">
  
    ### Closable

    The closable pill represents a value selected via another mechanism, and which the user can remove within the pill. It can appear on its own, such as alongside a complex filter panel, or within an input control such as [`ComboBox`](../combo-box).
