## Default pill (clickable)

Default pills are often used for quick actions such as an auto-generated response to a message. Default pills usually appear in groups of two or more.

## Closable pill

The closeable pill represents a value selected via another mechanism, and which the user can remove. It can appear on its own, such as alongside a complex filter panel, or within an input control such as ComboBox. Closeable pills can show as one or in multiples as more selections are made.

## Selectable pill group

Selectable pills are used in groups of two or more, never as a standalone pill component. They function as a more compact and visually appealing alternative to traditional checkboxes.  A checkbox is a part of the component and cannot be removed without customization.

### Wrapping

A group of selectable pills can wrap for smaller screens or to reserve space when there are many items.

### Form field compatibility

You can also wrap selectable pill groups in a form field when it’s displayed within a form.This provides functionality built into FormField for increased accessibility.

## With icons

Visually reinforce the theme or action of the pill by using left or right icons. The default pill has both left and right icons, while closeable pill and selectable pill only contain left icons. For more information, refer to icons.

## Disabled

You can set a pill to a disabled state, with no resultant action when the user interacts with it.
