    ### Default

    The default Pill is often used for tagging purposes, or to filter or change
    the page view. It can also be used to trigger an action that is subject to
    change as a result of user input or a change in context, such as an
    auto-generated quick response to a message.

    ### With Icon

    Icons can be displayed on the left of a default Pill label to visually
    reinforce the theme or grouping of that Pill, and for quick recognition.
