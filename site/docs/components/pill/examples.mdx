    ### Default

    The default Pill is often used for tagging purposes, or to filter or change the page view. You can also use Pill to trigger an action that is subject to change as a result of user input or a change in context, such as an auto-generated quick response to a message.

  <LivePreview componentName="pill" exampleName="Closable">
  
    ### Closable

    The closable pill represents a value that was selected via another mechanism, and which can be removed within the pill. It can appear on its own, for example, alongside a complex filter panelâ€”or within an input control such as [Combo Box](../combo-box).
