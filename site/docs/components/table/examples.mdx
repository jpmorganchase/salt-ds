## Basic

The table component is used to display tabular data in a structured format. All table elements are supported (`<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc.).

<LivePreview componentName="table" exampleName="Default" />

## Body variant

Table is available in several variants: primary, secondary and tertiary. The `variant` prop controls the background color of the table. This can be used to create different levels of hierarchy within your UI.

The `divider` prop can be used to adjust the appearance of the dividers in the table. It accepts: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` or `none`.

## Zebra

The `zebra` prop adds alternating row colors to improve readability. This is particularly useful for large datasets where distinguishing between rows can be challenging.

The color of the alternating rows is determined by the `variant` prop:

- `primary` variant uses the secondary background for alternating rows.
- `secondary` variant uses the primary background for alternating rows.
- `tertiary` variant uses the primary background for alternating rows.

The `divider` prop can be used to adjust the appearance of the dividers in the table. It accepts: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` or `none`.

## Header variant

The `variant` prop can also be applied to the table header. This allows you to create a visual distinction between the header and the body of the table.

The `divider` prop can be used to adjust the appearance of the dividers in the table. It accepts: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` or `none`.

## Footer variant

The `variant` prop can also be applied to the table footer. This allows you to create a visual distinction between the footer and the body of the table.

The `divider` prop can be used to adjust the appearance of the dividers in the table. It accepts: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` or `none`.

<LivePreview componentName="table" exampleName="TFootVariant" />

## Text alignment

You can control the text alignment of table cells and headers using the `textAlign` prop. It accepts: `left` or `right`.

### Best practices

- Numeric data should be right-aligned to improve readability.
