## Basic

The table component is used to display tabular data in a structured format. All table elements are supported (`<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, etc.).

<LivePreview componentName="table" exampleName="Default" />

## Variants

Table is available in several variants: primary, secondary and tertiary. The `variant` prop controls the background color of the table. This can be used to create different levels of hierarchy within your UI.

## Zebra

The zebra variant of the table adds alternating row colors to improve readability. This is particularly useful for large datasets where distinguishing between rows can be challenging.
The `zebra` prop can be used with the `variant` prop to achieve different styles.

Like `variant` the `zebra` prop supports three values: `primary`, `secondary`, and `tertiary`.

## Header variant

The `variant` prop can also be applied to the table header. This allows you to create a visual distinction between the header and the body of the table.

## Footer variant

The `variant` prop can also be applied to the table footer. This allows you to create a visual distinction between the footer and the body of the table.

<LivePreview componentName="table" exampleName="TFootVariant" />

## Dividers

The `divider` prop can be used to adjust the appearance of the dividers in the table. It is supported on the `Table`, `THead`, and `TFoot` components. It accepts: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary` or `none`.
