## Best practices

**Provide an accessible name for the `Table`**

- Use a `<caption>` element (preferred method) or apply `aria-labelledby` / `aria-label` attributes to the table
- The caption should clearly describe the table's content and purpose

**Provide an accessible name for the `TableContainer`**

- Reference the table's caption using `aria-labelledby` on the TableContainer, or provide a descriptive `aria-label`
- This ensures screen reader users can identify the scrollable region and understand its purpose when navigating into the area
- The container's label should match or complement the table's label for consistency
- This ensures compliance with WCAG 4.1.2 and prevents "unnamed region" errors

**Example:**

```jsx
<TableContainer aria-labelledby="table-caption">
  <Table>
    <caption id="table-caption">Quarterly Sales Data</caption>
    {/* table content */}
  </Table>
</TableContainer>
```

## Keyboard interactions

<KeyboardControls>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Tab">
    - Moves focus to the table container when the table is scrollable - When the
    container has focus, pressing Tab again moves focus to the next focusable
    element in the tab order
  </KeyboardControl>
  <KeyboardControl keyOrCombos="Arrow keys">
    - When the container has focus, arrow keys scroll the table content
    horizontally and vertically
  </KeyboardControl>
</KeyboardControls>
