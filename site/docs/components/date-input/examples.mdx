## DateInputSingle

<LivePreviewControls>

<LivePreview componentName="date-input" exampleName="Single">
### Uncontrolled single date input

An uncontrolled `DateInputSingle` component allows users to select a single date without the need for explicit state management in the parent component. The component internally manages the date value, making it ideal for simple forms where the date input does not need to be programmatically controlled or monitored.

### Controlled single date input

A controlled `DateInputSingle` component allows users to select a single date while the parent component explicitly manages the date value through state. This approach provides greater control over the date input, enabling validation, conditional rendering, and other dynamic behaviors based on the selected date.

<LivePreview componentName="date-input" exampleName="SingleBordered">
### Bordered single date input

A `DateInputSingle` component with a border provides a visually distinct input field for selecting a single date, enhancing the user interface by clearly delineating the date input area. This styling can improve usability and accessibility by making the input field more noticeable and easier to interact with.
