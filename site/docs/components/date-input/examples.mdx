<Callout title="Note">

All date components require a [LocalizationProvider](/salt/components/localization-provider/examples) to be set up in your application.
For the purpose of the examples, we use type `DateFrameworkType` so the examples can be used across all date adapters. For your own code you can replace this type with the type of your date object (e.g luxon would use `DateTime` type instead).

## DateInputSingle

### Uncontrolled single date input

An uncontrolled `DateInputSingle` component allows users to select a single date without the need for explicit state management in the parent component. The component internally manages the date value, making it ideal for simple forms where the date input does not need to be programmatically controlled or monitored.

<LivePreview componentName="date-input" exampleName="Single" />

### Controlled single date input

A controlled `DateInputSingle` component allows users to select a single date while the parent component explicitly manages the date value through state. This approach provides greater control over the date input, enabling validation, conditional rendering, and other dynamic behaviors based on the selected date.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-input"
  displayName="Single controlled"
  exampleName="SingleControlled"
/>

### Bordered single date input

A `DateInputSingle` component with a border provides a visually distinct input field for selecting a single date, enhancing the user interface by clearly delineating the date input area. This styling can improve usability and accessibility by making the input field more noticeable and easier to interact with.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-input"
  displayName="Bordered single date"
  exampleName="SingleBordered"
/>

### Custom Parsing

A custom parser can be provided through the `parse` prop.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-input"
  displayName="Custom Parser"
  exampleName="CustomParser"
/>

### Locale

A `DateInputSingle` component will use the locale defined by the nearest [LocalizationProvider](../LocalizationProvider) to determine locale specifics, such as date format.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-input"
  displayName="Single with locale"
  exampleName="SingleWithLocale"
/>

### Timezone

A `DateInputSingle` component can use the `timezone` prop to display the selected date in a specific timezone. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle date and time data across different time zones, ensuring that users can accurately select and view dates based on their local time.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-input"
  displayName="Single with timezone"
  exampleName="SingleWithTimezone"
/>

## DateInputRange

### Uncontrolled date range input

An uncontrolled `DateInputRange` component allows users to select a range of dates without the need for explicit state management in the parent component. The component internally manages the start and end date values, making it ideal for simple forms where the date range input does not need to be programmatically controlled or monitored.

<LivePreview componentName="date-input" exampleName="Range" />

### Controlled date range input

A controlled `DateInputRange` component allows users to select a range of dates while the parent component explicitly manages the start and end date values through state. This approach provides greater control over the date range input, enabling validation, conditional rendering, and other dynamic behaviors based on the selected date range.

<LivePreview
  componentName="date-input"
  displayName="Range controlled"
  exampleName="RangeControlled"
/>

### Bordered date range input

A `DateInputRange` component with a border provides a visually distinct input field for selecting a range of dates, enhancing the user interface by clearly delineating the date input area.

<LivePreview

<LivePreview

### Timezone

A `DateInputRange` component can use the `timezone` prop to display the selected date range in a specific timezone. This is particularly useful for applications that need to handle date and time data across different time zones, ensuring that users can accurately select and view date ranges based on their local time.
