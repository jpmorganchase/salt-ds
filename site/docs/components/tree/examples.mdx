## Default

The default `Tree` displays a collapsible hierarchy with single selection. Click a node to select it, or click the expand icon to reveal child nodes.

<LivePreview componentName="tree" exampleName="Default" />

## With icons

Use the `icon` prop on `TreeNode` to display an icon alongside the label. Icons help users quickly identify the type of content each node represents.

### Best practices

- Only use icons when they provide meaningful context to help users identify node types.
- Apply icons to all nodes or none for visual consistency. Mixing nodes with and without icons creates an unbalanced visual hierarchy.
- Use consistent icons for similar node types (e.g., folder icons for parent nodes, document icons for leaf nodes).
- Icons in a tree are decorative. Ensure that any information conveyed by icons is also available via the node label.

## Multiselect

Set `multiselect` to enable multiple node selection with checkboxes. This provides a clear visual indication of selection state and supports parent-child selection propagation.

### Best practices

- Use checkbox selection when users need to select multiple items for a bulk action.
- Selecting a parent node automatically selects all its children, and selecting all children automatically selects the parent.

## Disabled nodes

Use the `disabled` prop on individual `TreeNode` components to disable specific nodes. Disabled nodes cannot be selected, expanded, or interacted with.

<LivePreview componentName="tree" exampleName="DisabledNodes" />

## With tooltip

Use the `TreeNodeTrigger` and `TreeNodeLabel` components to wrap tree node content with a tooltip. This allows you to provide additional context or descriptions for nodes on hover and focus.

### Best practices

- Use tooltips to provide supplementary information. See [Tooltip](/salt/components/tooltip) for more information on usage.
