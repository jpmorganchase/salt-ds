## Using the component

`Tree` uses a composition model using `TreeNode` components within a `Tree` component to define hierarchy.

- Each `TreeNode` requires a unique `value` prop. This value identifies the node for expansion, selection, and disabled state tracking. Ensure values are unique across the entire tree.
- Use uncontrolled mode with `defaultExpanded` and `defaultSelected` for simple use cases, or controlled mode with `expanded` and `selected` props when you need to manage state externally.

See the [examples](/salt/components/tree/examples) for feature demonstrations including icons, multiselect, and disabled nodes.

### When to use

- To display hierarchical data with parent-child relationships, such as file systems, organizational structures or category taxonomies.
- When users need to navigate through nested levels of content and optionally select items.
- To allow users to expand and collapse sections to focus on relevant content.

### When not to use

- For navigation between pages or routes. Instead, use [`VerticalNavigation`](../vertical-navigation).
- For flat, non-hierarchical lists. Instead, use [`ListBox`](../list-box).
- When the hierarchy is only one level deep. Consider using [`Accordion`](../accordion) or a simple list.
