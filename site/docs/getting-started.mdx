# Getting Started

## Developing

Learn how to use Odyssey's [UI components](/docs/components/) in your React web applications.

### Pre-requisites

In order to use our components you will need:

- Familiarity with web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 or later installed on your system.
- A React (v16 or later) web application project.
  - For new projects, you can use [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app) or similar tools.

### Install packages

You will need to add the following three dependencies to your project:

```sh
npm install --save @jpmorganchase/uitk-core @jpmorganchase/uitk-theme @jpmorganchase/uitk-icons
```

:::note

If you prefer, you can use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or other package managers to install our NPM packages.

:::

- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-core` contains our production-ready UI components
- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme` contains the CSS files that apply Odyssey's default theme
- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-icons` contains our SVG-based icons

:::tip

We strongly recommend that you regularly update to newer, compatible versions of Odyssey as they are released. For example, if using `npm`, this can be achieved by running:

```sh
npm update @jpmorganchase/uitk-core @jpmorganchase/uitk-theme @jpmorganchase/uitk-icons
```

This will provide you with the latest bug fixes and enhancements and does not require you to update any of your own code.

Additionally, we recommend that you periodically check for new major versions (for example, via `npm outdated @jpmorganchase`) and aim to upgrade to those as soon as possible. Please note that new major versions will contain breaking changes, so always review the associated release notes and update your code as needed.

:::

### Initial setup

When integrating Odyssey into your project, you need to perform the following one-off steps:

- Include the theme CSS file (`@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme/index.css`) in your app
- Wrap your application in a `<ToolktiProvider>` component.

For example, in a typical React project, you can do this in your `src/index.js` as follows:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

// Import <ToolkitProvider>
import { ToolkitProvider } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

// Import theme CSS
import "@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme/index.css";

// Wrap your application in a <ToolkitProvider>
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <ToolkitProvider>
    <App />
  </ToolkitProvider>
);
```

### Next steps

Congratulations, you're now ready to use our UI components. Import them from the `@jpmorganchase/uitk-core` package and use them in your JSX code. For example:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

function App() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}

export default App;
```

Head over to our [component documentation](/docs/components/) to learn about the available components and their respective APIs.

### Labs components

Our `@jpmorganchase/uitk-labs` package is where we introduce new components which are under initial development until they are stable and moved over to the core package. This is typically an unstable environment and may have major breaking changes.

While we do not recommend using labs components in production applications, early adopters are welcome to use and experiment with them. We're keen to hear your feedback, bug reports and feature requests, so please don't hesitate to [raise new issues or comment on existing ones](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/uitk/issues).
