# Getting Started

## Developing

Learn how to use Odyssey's [UI components](/docs/components/) in your React web applications.

### Prerequisites

In order to use our components you will need:

- Familiarity with web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS & JavaScript) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16 or later installed on your system.
- A React (v16 or later) web application project.
  - For new projects, you can use [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app) or similar tools.

### Install packages

You will need to add the following 3 packages as dependencies to your project:

- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-core` which contains our production-ready UI components
- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme` which contains the CSS files that apply Odyssey's default theme
- `@jpmorganchase/uitk-icons` which contains our SVG-based icons

You can do this via `npm` like so:

```sh
npm install --save @jpmorganchase/uitk-core @jpmorganchase/uitk-theme @jpmorganchase/uitk-icons
```

:::note

If you prefer, you can use [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) or other package managers to install our NPM packages.

### Initial setup

When integrating Odyssey into your project, you need to perform the following one-off steps:

- Include the theme CSS file (`@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme/index.css`) in your app
- Import the `<ToolktiProvider>` component and wrap your application in it

For example, in a typical React project, you can do this in your `src/index.js` as follows:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

// Import <ToolkitProvider>
import { ToolkitProvider } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

// Import theme CSS
import "@jpmorganchase/uitk-theme/index.css";

// Wrap your application in a <ToolkitProvider>
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <ToolkitProvider>
    <App />
  </ToolkitProvider>
);
```

### Next steps

Congratulations, you're now ready to use our UI components. Import them from the `@jpmorganchase/uitk-core` package and use them in your JSX code. For example:

```jsx
import { Button } from "@jpmorganchase/uitk-core";

function App() {
  return <Button>Click me</Button>;
}

export default App;
```

Head over to our [component documentation](/docs/components/) to learn about the available components and their respective APIs.

### Labs components

Our `@jpmorganchase/uitk-labs` package is where we introduce new components which are under initial development until they are stable and moved over to the core package. This is typically an unstable environment and may have major breaking changes.

While we do not recommend using labs components in production applications, early adopters are welcome to use and experiment with them. We're keen to hear your feedback, bug reports and feature requests, so please don't hesitate to [raise new issues or comment on existing ones](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/uitk/issues).
