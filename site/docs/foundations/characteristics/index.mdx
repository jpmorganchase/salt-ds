A design token stores design decisions in a single place, so teams can use them across their work to create consistent experiences.

The Salt Design System uses three tiers of tokens. From most generalized to most specific, they are:

1. Foundational tokens
2. Characteristic design tokens
3. Component-specific tokens

Characteristics form sets of CSS variables that define a visual attribute, such as text or colors that denote status. They can then be reused by components where necessary, allowing for design consistency and logical patterns. They help to define the rules that style each component and aid the cohesiveness of the overall user interface.

## Benefits

For designers, they enable visual changes without impacting efficiency or effectiveness of components.

For developers, they offer an easy way to reuse the same values. It creates a single point of reference for commonly-used values, which means you only have to update in one place to reflect everywhere.

Characteristics offer the following benefits:

- Ability to theme Salt in line with third parties or CIB sub-brand guidelines.
- Increased consistency across all components, which improves the overall user experience e.g. reduced cognitive load.
- Simplified design of new components and patterns e.g. drag-and-drop behavior.
- Streamlined design changes—a characteristic tweak will automatically apply to all related components.

You can look at the Salt components' CSS files to see how they are styled.

## Token name convention

When defining characteristic design tokens, they should generally be in the format `--salt-<characteristic name>-<variant>-<attribute>-<state>`

1. Always begin with `--salt-`
2. Follow with the foundation name, e.g. `--salt-actionable-`, `--salt-text-`, `--salt-focused-`
3. Append the variant if applicable, e.g. `--salt-actionable-cta-`, `--salt-text-h2-`
4. Append the attribute, e.g. `--salt-actionable-cta-background`, `--salt-text-h2-fontSize`, `--salt-focused-outlineColor`
5. Append the state if applicable, e.g. `--salt-actionable-cta-background-hover`

## Styling with characteristics

Remember to wrap the characteristic you wish to use inside a `var()` function.

For example, a Button is a component on which a user can perform an action, so you can use the following characteristics to style the component:

```css
.saltButton {
  background: var(--salt-actionable-primary-background);
  font-weight: var(--salt-actionable-fontWeight);
}
```

Characteristics are both light/dark and density scoped, meaning that the value the characteristic points to will change according to the values given in the nearest `SaltProvider`.

That means that in the above example, `--salt-actionable-primary-background` resolves to `var(--salt-palette-interact-primary-background)`. In light theme this is `var(--salt-color-gray-60)` and in dark theme this is `var(--salt-color-gray-300)`. Foundation tokens then resolve to their respective RGBA values.

## When to apply

Generally, the characteristics appropriate for the component should be given by the design team. To decide which characteristics to use when styling a new component, it may be useful to ask questions like:

- What can the user do with this component? Can they click it, drag it, etc?
- What state can this component be in? Can it be focused, disabled, etc?
- What is the purpose of this component? Will it contain other elements, lead the user to a new page, etc?
- Should this component give feedback? Can it be submitted, does it have a success state, etc?

Just because you have assigned a characteristic to a component, does not mean it consumes _all_ of those characteristics. You can specify which characteristics you want to apply. 

A good example of this is the `focused` characteristic, which offers both border and outline style. You would use the outline token if you're setting the outline attribute, and the border token if setting the border attribute.

Think carefully when deciding which characteristics are most appropriate. For example, should the background color of your component be coming from container, because that's its general purpose, or should it be coming from selectable, since it can be selected? Many characteristics define the same attribute (e.g. background color), and it's important to decide which characteristic your component should use. This will ensure you have consistent styling across your user interface, especially when different themes are applied.
