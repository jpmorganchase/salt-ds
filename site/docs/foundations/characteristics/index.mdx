## About Characteristics

Characteristic design tokens are a level of abstraction sitting between the foundational tokens and the component-specific tokens.

Each grouping of characteristics (also known in other design systems as _semantics_) is a set of CSS variables which encapsulates a specific concept. These tokens can then be reused by multiple components where necessary, allowing for consistency across design and logical, reusable patterns.

### What are characteristics?

Characteristics are semantic groupings of visual attributes that are applied across relevant components. They drive consistency and support theming across complex libraries. They help to define the rules that style each component and aid the cohesiveness of the UI.

### Why characteristics?

From a design perspective, there is a need for aesthetic flexibility without decreasing the efficiency of build or the effectiveness of the components when implemented. From a dev perspective, it provides an easy way to reuse the same values, without the overhead of having to remember details such as hex values. Any time you want to tweak the value of a characteristic, you only have to do it in one place for it to reflect everywhere.

Characteristics offer the following benefits:

- Ability to theme the Salt inline with third-parties or CIB sub brand guidelines.
- Increase consistency across all components, with the knock-on effect of improving the overall user experience e.g. reduced cognitive load.
- Simplified design of new components and patterns e.g. drag-and-drop behavior.
- Streamlined evolution – a single change to a characteristic will automatically cascade down through all related components within the library.

### Token name convention

When defining characteristic design tokens, they should generally be in the format `--salt-<characteristic name>-<variant>-<attribute>-<state>`

1. Always begin with `--salt-`
2. Follow this by the foundation name, e.g. `---salt-actionable-`, `---salt-text-`, `--salt-focused-`
3. Append the variant if applicable, e.g. `--salt-actionable-cta-`, `--salt-text-h2-`
4. Append the attribute, e.g. `--salt-actionable-cta-background`, `--salt-text-h2-fontSize`, `--salt-focused-outlineColor`
5. Append the state if applicable, e.g. `--salt-actionable-cta-background-hover`

### Styling with Characteristics

Remember to wrap the characteristic you wish to use inside a `var()` function.

For example, a Button is a component on which a user can perform an action, so you could use the following characteristics to style the component:

```css
.saltButton {
  background: var(--salt-actionable-primary-background);
  font-weight: var(--salt-actionable-fontWeight);
}
```

Characteristics are both light/dark and density scoped, meaning that the value the characteristic points to will change according to the values given in the nearest `SaltProvider`. Considering the above, we would get that in light
theme, `--salt-actionable-primary-background` resolves to `var(--salt-palette-interact-primary-background)`, which in light theme is `var(--salt-color-gray-60)` and in dark theme is `var(--salt-color-gray-300)`, of which foundation tokens then in turn resolve to their respective RGBA values.

### How do I know which characteristics to apply?

Generally, the characteristics appropriate for the component should be given by the design team. To decide which characteristics to use when styling a new component, it may be useful to ask questions like:

- What can the user do with this component? Can they click it, drag it, etc?
- What state can this component be in? Can it be focused, disabled, etc?
- What is the purpose of this component? Will it contain other elements, lead me to a new page, etc?
- Should this component give feedback? Can it be submitted, does it have a success state, etc?

It is important to note that just because you have assigned a characteristic to a component, does not mean it consumes _all_ of those characteristics. We can freely pick which characteristics we want. A good example of this may be to notice that the `focused` characteristic offers both a border and outline style. From this you would want to use the outline token if you're setting the outline attribute, and the border token if setting the border attribute.

Think carefully when deciding which characteristics are most appropriate. For example, should the background color of your component be coming from container, because that's its general purpose, or should it be coming from selectable, since it can be selected? Many characteristics host for the same attribute (e.g. background color), and it's important to make the correct decision as to which characteristic your component should adopt the token from. Taking time to consider this will ensure you have the most consistent styling possible across your app, especially when different themes are applied.

## How do I know which characteristics the Salt components are using?

Each component has a breakdown of the characteristics used on its documentation page within Storybook. You can also dive into the components CSS files to see exactly how they are styled.
