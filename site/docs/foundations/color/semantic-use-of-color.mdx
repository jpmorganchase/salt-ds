Colors are divided into several categories to communicate several concepts across the Salt design system.

### Status

Status colors are visual indicators that reflect changes in the state or condition of a system or process. These colors help users understand whatâ€™s happening, what actions are needed, and whether any issues need to be addressed.

The Salt design system includes 4 statuses:

| Status  | Color  |
| ------- | ------ |
| Info    | Blue   |
| Error   | Red    |
| Warning | Orange |
| Success | Green  |

### Sentiment

Sentiment colors guide users through an interface by providing visual cues about potential outcomes and evoking specific feelings. Sentiment can be used independently of status.

The Salt design system includes 5 sentiments:

| Sentiment | Color                                              | Feeling     |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Negative  | Red                                                | Negativity  |
| Caution   | Orange                                             | Carefulness |
| Neutral   | Gray                                               | Comfort     |
| Accent    | Teal (JPM brand theme) or blue (Legacy UITK theme) | Trust       |
| Positive  | Green                                              | Positivity  |

### Accent

Accent is a concept within sentiment and is used to highlight key elements of an interface, such as an active tab or an important headline. The accent color serves as the dominant 'brand' color in a theme and conveys a sense of trust.
