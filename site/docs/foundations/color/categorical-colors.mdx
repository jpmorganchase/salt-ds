Salt’s categorical palette is designed for [data visualization](salt/foundations/data-visualization/color-and-pattern) and components that represent distinct categories, featuring 20 unique colors and their corresponding ramps.

To learn how to use categorical colors effectively, see the [Category characteristic](salt/themes/design-tokens/category-characteristic) guide.
