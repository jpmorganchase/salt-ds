<Callout status="warning">
  Salt recommends using the JPM brand theme for your product, as the legacy (UITK) color palette is not aligned with current brand standards and may present accessibility challenges. The legacy palette is provided primarily to support migration from UI Toolkit to Salt, and should only be used when necessary for compatibility.
