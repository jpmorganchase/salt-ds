Division helps to separate content areas or grouped elements. It provides a sense of visual hierarchy and can improve the scanability of information.

## Space

Negative space is the area between elements within design. It can also be the space within individual components, for instance the space between an icon and a label within a button.

When it comes to dividing regions, blocks of content or elements within a design, negative space should be the first option. Its’ an elegant visual divider that helps to break up an interface without creating unnecessary visual clutter.

## Layering

Monochromatic color blocking

## Contrast

Zebra striping data grids

## Separators

Separators are used to divide regions of a layout, sections of content or groups of related components or data.

It is recommended to use separators only if the content cannot be effectively divided in another way. Too many lines can overload a design and create unnecessary visual noise.

Salt provides three types of separation:

- **Primary** – used to separate areas of content that are not closely related, such as an app header from the app content.
- **Secondary** – divides related areas, for instance, heading and body text within a content block.
- **Tertiary** – Should only be applied when subtle division is required. Its used to divide similar items within a group, for example, options within a list, or individual comments in a conversation thread.

### Full-bleed separators

TBD

### Inset separators

TBD

## Borders

Borders are used to encapsulate pieces of related content and or components.

Regardless of size or density, borders remain 1px thick throughout the design system.
