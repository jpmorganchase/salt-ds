Color is a valuable tool that helps effectively present data in your visualization. Using color correctly guides users’ attention and supports their understanding and interpretation of data.

## Color usage

Consider the purpose and impact of color in your chart. Color can be used to:

- **Show relationships**:
Use similar colors to imply that items are related. Contrasting colors, however, show that items are from distinct categories.

- **Represent data values**:
Color helps to give a clearer indication of range and how data values are distributed; for instance, highs and lows.

- **Highlight key elements**:
Use color to direct your audience's attention towards the main element or emphasize data that supports the story you’re communicating.

- **Indicate meaning**:
Some colors are strongly associated with certain objects, concepts or emotions. Leveraging these associations helps you communicate more efficiently and improves comprehension of your chart.

## Categorical palette

The categorical palette is designed to visualize distinct groups of items. Categories are designed to be displayed in numerical order to maximize color contrast and visual clarity. It is recommended not to associate status or sentiment with category colors, as these are covered by separate characteristics. Additionally, the color assigned to each numerical category may vary between themes or if the palette is updated in the future, so relying on color for meaning could lead to inconsistencies.

## Patterns

According to [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html), color shouldn’t be the only distinguishing factor to convey information about your data. To improve accessibility for users with different needs, always include additional visual cues, such as line patterns and pattern fills. The order of line patterns and pattern fills is predefined to support consistency and ease of interpretation.

### Line patterns

Line patterns can be used in charts that display multiple lines, helping users distinguish between different data series. Salt provides 19 distinct line patterns to support clear and accessible data visualization.

### Pattern fills

Charts that include two-dimensional shapes with area, such as rectangles or slices, can be enhanced with pattern fills. Salt offers 20 distinct pattern fills to help differentiate data sets..
