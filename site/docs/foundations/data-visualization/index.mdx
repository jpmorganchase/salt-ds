Data visualization presents information in a visual form that’s easy to understand. When applied to dense and complex datasets, it aids in highlighting trends and patterns.

The Salt Charts leverage Highcharts components and functionality, applying a styling layer via Salt tokens.

## Chart selection

Choosing the best chart for your use case depends on:

- The chart’s function
- The nature of the data you’re displaying
- The device used for viewing
- Your users’ expectations
- Visual literacy

Once you’ve identified what the data visualization should achieve, select the chart type that best aligns with your needs.

## Chart types

With a wide range of chart formats available, you can choose from several categories, each designed to serve a specific purpose.

### Change over time
