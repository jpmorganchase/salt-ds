Charts rely heavily on visuals to help users understand complex data, so it’s important to ensure that your charts meet all accessibility requirements. Use color appropriately, include visual cues, provide text for assistive technologies, and ensure any interactions are accessible.

## Categorical colors

### Color contrast

Users with visual impairments should be able to fully comprehend data sets that are represented by different colors. If you use custom colors or Hex codes, they may not meet non-text contrast requirements so you will be responsible to ensure that the resulting contrast is compliant. By using Salt tokens correctly, you will achieve at least 3:1 contrast between the background and other non-text chart elements such as bars, lines, segments and icons.

### Color order

Apply the categorical colors in the recommended order, from 1 through 20.

A well-defined, distinct color palette ensures that everyone can easily interpret the data. Using the set categorical palette colors minimizes the risk of misinterpretation and ensures a visual order. Don’t use shades of the same color.

You can enhance your chart’s accessibility by adopting additional visual strategies other than color such as:

- Pattern overlays for different categories
- Direct labelling where possible
- Adding a border with at least a 3:1 contrast ratio against the background to distinguish between segments

You can show chart data in a table or list nearby, in an overlay, or on another screen as a last resort to support screen readers. If essential information is on a separate screen, then it could disrupt the cohesive flow of information. Screen reader users would need to navigate back and forth between the two parts of the text alternative for the complex image, which could disrupt the flow of information.

For more information about text alternatives, read the [JPMC UX Accessibility Resources](https://go/text-alternatives#TextAlternatives-Compleximages) (Internal users only).

## Line patterns

Color shouldn’t be the only visual cue. Include other visual cues such as text, patterns, or symbols to help the user differentiate between different data sets. Consider using line patterns for multiple line series. Patterns improve readability, especially for those with color vision requirements.

## Pattern fills

Use pattern fills for 2-dimensional shapes, such as bars and slices. Pattern fills are always black and applied to solid categorical colors for charts. They’re beneficial in scenarios in which there is only one visual distinction between data points.

## Marker symbols

In addition to line patterns and pattern fills, you can add shape or icon markers to make data points more distinctive. Varied marker symbols help differentiate lines. Marker symbols have a white border in both light and dark modes for accessibility.

By default, Salt uses predefined symbols in the following order:

- Circle
- Diamond
- Square
- Triangle
- Triangle-down
