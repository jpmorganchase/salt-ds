Charts rely on visual elements to make complex data easier to understand, so it’s essential to ensure they are accessible to all users. Use color appropriately, include visual cues, provide text for assistive technologies, and ensure any interactions are accessible.

## Categorical colors

### Color contrast

Users with visual impairments should be able to fully understand data that is represented using different colors. The use of custom colors or hex codes is discouraged, as they may not meet non-text contrast requirements and can compromise accessibility. Salt tokens should be used to ensure compliance, as they are designed to achieve at least a 3:1 contrast ratio between the background and non-text chart elements such as bars, lines, segments, and icons.

### Color order

Salt's categorical colors are intended to be used in numerical order, from 1 through 20.

A well-defined, distinct color palette ensures that everyone can easily interpret the data. Using the set categorical palette colors minimizes the risk of misinterpretation and ensures a visual order. Don’t apply similar categorical color colors to the same chart.

You can enhance your chart’s accessibility by adopting additional visual strategies other than color such as:

- Pattern overlays for different categories
- Direct labelling where possible
- Adding a border with at least a 3:1 contrast ratio against the background to distinguish between segments

You can present chart data in a nearby table or list, in an overlay, or -if necessary- as a last resort on a separate screen to support screen readers. However, placing essential information on a separate screen can disrupt the flow of information. Screen reader users may need to navigate back and forth between different sections to access the full text alternative for a complex image, which can make understanding the data more difficult.

For more information about text alternatives, read the [JPMC UX Accessibility Resources](https://go/text-alternatives#TextAlternatives-Compleximages) (Internal users only).

## Line patterns

Color shouldn't be the only visual cue used in charts. Always include additional cues such as text, patterns, or symbols to help users distinguish between different data sets. For example, use line patterns to differentiate multiple line series. Patterns and other visual indicators improve readability, especially for users with color vision requirements.

## Pattern fills

Use pattern fills for two-dimensional shapes, such as bars and slices. Pattern fills should always be black and applied over solid categorical colors in charts. They are especially helpful when there is only one visual distinction between data points, ensuring that all users can easily differentiate between chart elements.

## Marker symbols

In addition to line patterns and pattern fills, you can add marker symbols to make data points more distinctive and help differentiate lines. Marker symbols have a white border in both light and dark modes for accessibility. If you have more than five data series, the additional series will simply use the first symbol again. The symbols cycle through the available options, so for a sixth series, it would revert back to the first symbol in the defined set.

Salt uses predefined symbols in the following order:

- Circle
- Diamond
- Square
- Triangle (up)
- Triangle-down
