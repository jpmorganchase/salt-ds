A responsive layout makes dynamic changes to the appearance of a product in response to a user's behavior and/or environment based on screen size, platform, orientation or zoom level.

Responsiveness provides a fluid and flexible layout that adapts to screen size and offers an optimized experience.

## Types

There are two types of layout behavior; Responsive and Adaptive.

### Responsive

Responsive design changes the layout of elements on the screen (including hiding/showing some elements) based on the size of the screen, e.g. a design will reflow as you resize the browser window to ensure the application remains usable.

### Adaptive

In adaptive design, the nature of components used on a screen changes based on the device being used, e.g., a desktop browser window and a tablet browser, both set to the same size, would display different componentry to suit a keyboard/mouse vs. touch context.

In other words, an adaptive UI adapts itself to the capabilities of the device on which it's displayed, while a responsive UI simply responds to changes in viewport size.

## Breakpoints

In responsive and adaptive design, a breakpoint is the point (width) at which a layout will adapt in order to provide the best possible user experience. The number of columns in a layout varies dependent on the breakpoint and [density](density) set. For each combination the margin and gutter size remains constant, whereas the width of each column will vary as a percentage of the overall width.

### High density

| Breakpoint  | Width (pixels) | Columns | Margin and gutter size (token) |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Extra Small | 0 - 599        | 2       | `--salt-spacing-300`                  |
| Small       | 600 - 959      | 4       | `--salt-spacing-300`                  |
