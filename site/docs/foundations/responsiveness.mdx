A responsive layout makes dynamic changes to the appearance of a product in response to a user's behavior and/or environment based on screen size, platform, orientation or zoom level. 

Responsiveness provides a fluid and flexible layout that adapts to screen size and offers an optimized experience.

## Types

There are two types of layout behavior; Responsive and Adaptive. 

### Responsive
Responsive design changes the layout of elements on the screen (including hiding/showing some elements) based on the size of the screen, e.g. a design will reflow as you resize the browser window to ensure the application remains usable.

### Adaptive
In adaptive design, the nature of components used on a screen changes based on the device being used, e.g., a desktop browser window and a tablet browser, both set to the same size, would display different componentry to suit a keyboard/mouse vs. touch context.

In other words, an adaptive UI adapts itself to the capabilities of the device on which it's displayed, while a responsive UI simply responds to changes in viewport size.

## Breakpoints

In responsive and adaptive design, a breakpoint is the point (width) at which a layout will adapt in order to provide the best possible user experience.

| Breakpoint | Width (pixels) | Columns | Margin and gutter size | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| Extra Small | 0 - 599 |||
| Small | 600 - 959 |||
| Medium | 960 - 1279 |||
| Large | 1280-1919 |||
| Extra Large | >1920 |||
