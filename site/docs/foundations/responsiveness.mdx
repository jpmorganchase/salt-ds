A responsive layout dynamically changes the appearance of a product in response to a user's behavior and/or environment based on screen size, platform, orientation or zoom level.

Responsiveness provides a fluid, flexible layout that adapts to screen size and offers an optimized experience.

## Types

There are two types of layout behavior: responsive and adaptive.

### Responsive

Responsive design adjusts the layout of elements on the screen including hiding or showing some elements based on the size of the screen, e.g. a design will reflow as you resize the browser window to ensure the application remains usable.

### Adaptive

In adaptive design, the types of components used on a screen changes based on the device e.g., a desktop browser window and a tablet browser, both set to the same size, would display different componentry to suit a keyboard/mouse vs. touch context.

In other words, an adaptive user interface (UI) adapts itself to the device capabilities, while a responsive UI simply responds to changes in viewport size.

## Breakpoints

In responsive and adaptive design, a breakpoint is the point (width) at which a layout will adapt to provide the best user experience. The number of columns in a layout varies based on the breakpoint and [density](density) set. The margin and gutter size remains constant for each combination, whereas column width will vary as a percentage of the overall width.

### High density

| Breakpoint  | Width (pixels) | Columns | Margin and gutter size (token) |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
| Extra small | 0–599          | 2       | `--salt-spacing-300`           |
| Small       | 600–959        | 4       | `--salt-spacing-300`           |
| Medium      | 960–1279       | 6       | `--salt-spacing-300`           |
| Large       | 1280–1919      | 8       | `--salt-spacing-300`           |
| Extra Large | >1920          | 12      | `--salt-spacing-300`           |

### Medium density

| Breakpoint  | Width (pixels) | Columns | Margin and gutter size (token) |

### Low density

| Breakpoint  | Width (pixels) | Columns | Margin and gutter size (token) |
