Density relates to the amount of content that can fit on a screen based on the size and spacing of components. Choose a base density as a starting point when creating a product using Salt. All components, spacing, and typographic elements will align and remain proportionate regardless of the density you choose. Density can be changed at a page or region level. For more information about mixing densities, please refer to the [mixing densities section](#mixing-densities) on this page.

To learn how to change Salt density with Figma variables, watch [our demo video](https://go/techtube/#/videos/c7717cb0-4332-4cf0-9c8c-7f66e5eaf339) by the design team. (Internal users only)

For information on how to implement density in code, you can learn more on the [Salt provider page](/salt/components/salt-provider/examples#density).

Salt offers 4 densities:

| Density | Use case                                                                         |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High    | Optimized for data-heavy or complex applications such as trading platforms       |
| Medium  | Optimized for standard applications and websites at default density              |
| Low     | Optimized for data/content-light interfaces such as marketing and communications |
| Touch   | Optimized for touch interactions in mobile and tablet devices                    |

## High density (HD)

High density scales components down to their smallest size and reduces the size between elements to ensure a compact layout. High density is designed for frequent application use by experienced users.

## Medium density (MD)

Medium density is the default solution for most use cases. It's ideal for most standard applications or content-rich websites.

## Low density (LD)

Low density is optimized for content-light interfaces. It's ideal for marketing, communications, or onboarding experiences. In contrast to high density, low density is intended for infrequently used applications by inexperienced users.

## Touch density (TD)

Touch densityâ€™s main purpose is to address accessibility concerns on smaller viewports that deal with higher resolutions. When a screen has a higher resolution, touch targets are adjusted to remain large enough for easy interaction.

For more information on how to adjust typography and spacing in TD, please refer to the [small viewports page](/salt/foundations/small-viewports).

## Mixing densities

Density is intended to be used one at a time, only changing when part of a responsive breakpoint. To learn more about densities at various breakpoints, please refer to the [breakpoints page](/salt/foundations/breakpoints).

When applying density:

- Pick a density and be consistent with it across your application
- Alternatively, set density to align to breakpoints and define which density to use per breakpoint
- If the use case requires it, you can mix densities only at a regional level and not at a component level

Before mixing densities, consider other ways to establish hierarchy or emphasise certain elements:

- Using typographic hierarchy or weight
- Mixing primary and secondary background colors
- Applying greater spacing between elements
- Scaling components
