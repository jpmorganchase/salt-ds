Density relates to the amount of content that can fit on a screen based on the size and spacing of components.

When creating a product using the design system, choose a base density as a starting point. All components, spacing, and typographic elements will align and remain proportionate regardless of the density you choose.

There are four densities available to choose from: High, Medium, Low and Touch.

### High density (HD)

High density scales components down to their smallest size. High density is optimized for data-heavy or complex applications, such as trading platforms.

### Medium density (MD)

Medium density is the default solution for most use cases. It is ideal for most standard applications or content-rich websites.

### Low density (LD)

Low density is optimized for data or content-light interfaces. It's ideal for marketing, communications, or onboarding experiences.

### Touch density (TD)

Touch density scales components to their largest increment, and is intended only for mobile or tablet devices.
