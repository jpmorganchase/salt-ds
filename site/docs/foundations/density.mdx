Density relates to the amount of content that can fit on a screen based on the size and spacing of components. Choose a base density as a starting point when creating a product using Salt. All components, spacing, and typographic elements will align and remain proportionate regardless of the density you choose. Density can be changed at a page or region level.

Read about implementing density in code on the [SaltProvider](https://www.saltdesignsystem.com/salt/components/salt-provider/examples) documentation.

| Desk Density | Use case                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High         | Ideal for data-heavy or complex applications, such as trading platforms, where maximum information needs to be displayed efficiently  |
| Medium       | Suited for standard applications and websites, providing a balanced default density for most use cases                                |
| Low          | Best for data-light or content-focused interfaces, such as marketing and communications, where a spacious layout enhances readability |

## High density

High density scales components down to their smallest size and reduces the size between elements to ensure a compact layout. High density is designed for frequent application use by experienced users.

## Medium density

Medium density is suitable for most use-cases. It's ideal for standard applications or content-rich websites.

## Low density

Low density is optimized for content-light interfaces. It's ideal for marketing, communications, or onboarding experiences. In contrast to high density, low density is intended for infrequently used applications by inexperienced users.

## Mobile density

Mobile density optimizes component sizing and spacing for smaller screens, ensuring touch targets are accessible and layouts remain clear and usable. It delivers a consistent, intuitive experience for users on mobile and tablet platforms, regardless of the amount of information displayed.

## Touch density

Touch density’s main purpose is to address accessibility concerns on smaller viewports that deal with higher resolutions. When a screen has a higher resolution, touch targets are adjusted to remain large enough for easy interaction.

  Touch density will be removed in the next breaking change.

It was originally introduced to support basic touch accessibility, but is not optimized for smaller screens—as density increases, components and spacing become larger, leading to inefficient layouts and usability issues on mobile devices.

What you should do:

- For smaller devices, migrate to mobile density.
- For desktop or web applications, migrate to low density for the best experience.

Refer to the [Migrating from touch to mobile density](https://developer.test.aws.jpmchase.net/salt/content/news/20260204-migrating-from-touch-to-mobile-density) (Internal users only) for step-by-step instructions.

## Choosing density

Select a density early in the design process to align with your application’s requirements. We recommend using a single density throughout an application for consistency. Salt’s scaling system ensures components fit together seamlessly when using the same density. Avoid mixing densities at the component level, as this can cause alignment issues and reduce design quality.

## Switching density

In some cases, you may want to switch density to optimize the experience for different devices or screen sizes. There are two main approaches:

1. By screen size (breakpoints): change density as the viewport crosses defined breakpoints. For more information on breakpoints, see the [breakpoints](https://saltdesignsystem-bgsbjnzq6-fed-team.vercel.app/salt/foundations/responsiveness/breakpoints) documentation.

2. By device type: change density depending on whether the user is on a mobile, tablet, or desktop device. See an example of this in the [SaltProvider](https://saltdesignsystem-bgsbjnzq6-fed-team.vercel.app/salt/components/salt-provider/examples) documentation.
