Density relates to the amount of content that can fit on a screen based on the component size and spacing.

Choose a base density as a starting point when creating a product using the design system. All components, spacing, and typographic elements will align and remain proportionate regardless of the density you choose.

Four densities are available: high, medium, low and touch.

### High density

High density scales components down to their smallest size. High density is optimized for data-heavy or complex applications, such as trading platforms.

### Medium density

Medium density is the default solution for most use cases. It is ideal for most standard applications or content-rich websites.

### Low density

Low density is optimized for data or content-light interfaces. It's ideal for marketing, communications, or onboarding experiences.

### Touch density

Touch density scales components to their largest increment, and is intended only for mobile or tablet devices.
