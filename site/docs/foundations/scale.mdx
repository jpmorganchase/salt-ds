Scale allows components to be given greater or lesser prominence within an interface through a multiplier of their default size.

Scale works hand-in-hand with [density](density) to allow the prominence of certain simple components, such as Avatar and Country Symbol, to be changed within a layout. This is acheived by applying a basic multiplier (x2, x3, x4 etc.) to the base size of the component.

By using a multiplier, the component maintains a consistent spatial relationship to the elements around it.
