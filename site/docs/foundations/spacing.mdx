The organization of space is a key aspect of design. Saltâ€™s spatial tokens help align layouts and create consistent visual rhythm.

Salts spacing system is structured around a 4px base unit. This determines the density ramp for spacing and dimensions across the design system to help create a consistent visual aesthetic.

** Spacing tokens
