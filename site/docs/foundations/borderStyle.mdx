The border style foundation provides a standardized set of design tokens to ensure consistent border styles across all components and patterns.

## Border style variants

| Token                       | Value  |
| --------------------------- | ------ |
| `--salt-borderStyle-dashed` | dashed |
| `--salt-borderStyle-dotted` | dotted |
| `--salt-borderStyle-solid`  | solid  |

## Solid

Solid border style is the default value used throughout the Salt design system. It provides a continuous unbroken line for components such as containers, buttons and dividers.

## Dashed

Dashed border style is typically used to visually indicate drag/drop targets, such as the [File Drop Zone](../components/file-drop-zone) component.

## Dotted

Dotted border style is typically used to indicate a temporary or incomplete process or content block, an example of this is the track between incomplete steps in the [Stepper](../components/stepper) component.
