The time between the moment a user performs an action and the moment feedback is given by the system. Consistency in timing provides comfort and can increase trust in a system.

## Duration scale

There are four durations available to choose from: Instant, Perceptible, Notable and Cut-off.

| Token                         | Duration (milliseconds) |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `--salt-duration-instant`     | 100                     |
| `--salt-duration-perceptible` | 300                     |
| `--salt-duration-notable`     | 1000                    |
| `--salt-duration-cutoff`      | 10000                   |

### Instant (0-100ms)

An instant duration is the immediate response by the system to a user’s interaction, within a time frame of 0-100ms. The response should take no more than 100ms to complete. The types of interactions that can trigger an instant response include hovering over a button, clicking on a radio button, typing into an editable field, or dragging an object. No feedback is required as the system response itself is the feedback. 

### Perceptible (300ms)

A perceptible duration is a short, but detectable delay between a user's action and the system's response. The user should be aware of the gap but retain the feeling of control. This implies a shared control between the user and the interface itself—the user expects the system to process the interaction they have enabled the system to do. However, the delay should feel acceptable, and therefore maintain the user’s attention and productivity. This aligns with the “Doherty Threshold” principle which dictates that a user experience turns from painful to addictive after the system feedback time drops below 400ms. Tooltips and overlays are examples of perceptible delays.

Perceptible is recommended for when you want to reveal secondary guidance or information to your user, but it doesn't warrant a permanent place within the interface. Content typically has a relatively high level of urgency, so that users can quickly find solutions to their problems and avoid getting frustrated with the system.

### Notable (1s)

With a notable duration, the user is aware the system is slow to respond. A feeling of loss of control may occur, which is why it's important the delay is clearly communicated. Notable delays are intentional and may be required in order to load a data grid or retrieve search results. Should users experience delays longer than 1s they may feel held back by the system.

A 1s delay is usually the maximum limit for experiencing an interaction as being one continuous flow. The user understands a ‘notable’ duration as a two-way interaction between them and the system.  By contrast, with an instant (100ms) duration, users feel an outcome of the interaction has been directly caused by them.

With a delay of 1s (salt-duration-notable) there is no need for visual feedback to be provided to the user, however, it can be used as a breakpoint – once a delay has exceeded the 'notable' duration it is useful to indicate to the user that the system is working on the problem, for example by displaying a progress indicator or loading state.

### The time between notable and cut-off

The time between salt-duration-notable and salt-duration-cutoff indicates that the system requires a longer time to process an action past a ‘notable’ duration, but with the reassurance that the action will complete up until the cut-off point. Like ‘notable’, the user is relying on the system to “work” on providing an outcome, but they may momentarily feel a loss of control as their workflow has been interrupted. Appropriate visual feedback should be displayed at this point to provide reassurance that the interface will continue processing an action as intended. It would remain present until cut-off. 

#### Recommended visual feedback:

Spinner is a visual representation of a process that is taking an indeterminate amount of time to complete. A spinner can be displayed at any point between ‘notable’ and ‘cut-off’ durations, but should not be displayed any sooner as the assumption should be that the users actions will have completed before it is necessary to show a loading state. 

### Cut-off (10s)

The average person’s attention span has a limit of 10 seconds. Beyond this period of time, users are likely to start mentally context-switching. ‘Salt-duration-cutoff’ is the point at which any attempt for a system to respond should finish and a status message is displayed.

To prevent a frustrating or unproductive user experience, the time up until a cut-off duration can be used for:

Displaying messages that inform the user of the current interaction and which processes are taking time.
Displaying general hints and tips to using the application.
If possible, allowing the user to continue using other parts of the UI whilst the content loads.

#### By-passing the 10 second cut-off point:

There may be a requirement for a system to continue loading an interaction for an indeterminate amount of time, past the cut-off point, due to a workflow dependancy. A system may need to support a highly performant UI containing significant amounts of data points concurrently updating on a UI. 

It is recommended that if a duration exceeds the cut-off point, appropriate visual feedback is implemented that not only prevents the system from slowing down, but also provides enough visual affordance for the user to successfully navigate a busy UI environment. 

It is therefore acceptable to implement a duration of longer than 10 seconds, provided:

The outcome doesn’t require user input or response.
The user is able to switch their attention to alternative tasks during the duration time.
The interaction that has a longer duration time is independent from, and doesn’t affect time sensitivity, of parallel interactions.
