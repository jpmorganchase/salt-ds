The time between the moment a user performs an action and the moment feedback is given by the system. Consistency in timing provides comfort and can increase trust in a system.

There are four durations available to choose from; Instant, Perceptible, Notable, and Cut-off.

## Duration scale

|Token| Duration (milliseconds) |
|---|---|
|`duration-instant`| 100 |
|`duration-perceptible`| 300 |
|`duration-notable`| 1000 |
|`duration-cutoff`| 10000 |

### Instant

- 100ms
- Instant response to a user interaction e.g. hover, click, type, drag

### Perceptible

- 300ms
- Short but perceptible delay, user is aware but retains feeling of control – delay feels acceptable e.g. tooltip, overlay

### Notable

- 1,000ms
- User is aware the system is slow to respond, user will feel a loss of control – delay must be communicated to the user e.g. loading a data grid, retrieving search results

### Cut-off

- 10,000ms
- Delay cut-off. 10 seconds is the average attention span limit, user is likely to mentally context switch if delayed beyond this point.
