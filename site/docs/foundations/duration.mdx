The time between the moment a user performs an action and the moment feedback is given by the system. Consistency in timing provides comfort and can increase trust in a system.

## Duration scale

There are four durations available to choose from: Instant, Perceptible, Notable and Cut-off.

| Token                         | Duration (milliseconds) |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `--salt-duration-instant`     | 100                     |
| `--salt-duration-perceptible` | 300                     |
| `--salt-duration-notable`     | 1000                    |
| `--salt-duration-cutoff`      | 10000                   |

### Instant

The immediate response by the system to a users interaction, such as hovering over a button, clicking on a radio button, typing into an editable field, or dragging an object. TEST

### Perceptible

A short but detectable delay between a user's action and the system's response. The user should be aware of the gap but retain the feeling of control. In essence, the delay should feel acceptable. Tooltips and overlays are examples of perceptible delays.

### Notable

With a notable delay, the user is aware the system is slow to respond. A feeling of loss of control may occur, which is why it's important the delay is clearly communicated. Notable delays may be required in order to load a data grid or retrieve search results.

### Cut-off

The average attention span has a limit of 10 seconds. Beyond this period of time, users are likely to start mentally context-switching. "Cut-off" is the point at which any attempt for a system to respond is finished and a status message is displayed.
