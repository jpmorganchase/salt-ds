Typography involves the style and appearance of written language. It plays a crucial role in enhancing readability, establishing hierarchy, and setting a visual tone, resulting in more effective and expressive communication.

If you’re using the Salt Next theme please also refer to the listed typography guidance on the [Themes page](/salt/themes/index).

## Font family

The current Salt theme uses the open-source, sans-serif typeface **Open Sans**. It’s the sole typeface for all text styles, with the exception of code which uses the mono space typeface, **PT Mono**.

## Font weight

Weight refers to the relative thickness of a font’s stroke. Each type style includes three weights which enable you to create visual hierarchy within the same text size.

Please note that in the Salt design system, 'Strong' indicates bolder weight than the default, whereas 'Small' represents a thinner weight, which may differ from traditional terminology where [small](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small) represents side-comments and small print.

## Type hierarchy

Type hierarchy arranges text elements by varying font sizes, weights, and styles. This guides the reader's attention and conveys content structure.

### Display

Display styles are primarily for representing key metrics and mastheads.

### Headings

Headings separate sections of content into varying levels.

### Body

Body is the default style for most components and text blocks.

### Label

Labels display a small amount of text that helps people understand the current context of a component.

### Help

Help text provides additional information or instructions, such as accepted data formats for input or file types for upload.

## Line height

Line height controls the space between baselines within a block of text and should be proportional to the text size, typically set at 1.3x the font size across all styles. Line height may also vary with text density.

## Case

There are three cases recommended within our content guidelines:

### Sentence case

Sentence case is primarily used for body copy, page titles, navigation, subheadings, form titles, field labels, and chart/data visualization titles and text.

### Title case

Title case should only be used for proper nouns and job titles. Proper nouns refer to specific individuals, companies, products, or objects.

### All capitals

All capitals are used for button labels to give them prominence and to differentiate them from other graphical elements. Never use all caps in general writing.

## Italics

Italics are applied sparingly to short pieces of text to help differentiate text. They serve to differentiate text from the surrounding content and should be used independent of changing font weight.

Full sentences or blocks of text are generally not italicized. Combining italics with font weight for emphasis is not recommended.

## Notation

Notation is a text style characterized by its discrete font size, making it ideal for use in confined spaces such as the Avatar and Badge components. This style is also well-suited for footnotes and disclaimers, ensuring that important but less prominent information is clearly communicated without overwhelming the main content.
