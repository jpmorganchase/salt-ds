Typography can help to enhance readability, establish hierarchy and set a visual tone, resulting in more effective communication.

## Fonts

<Image
  src="/img/foundations/typography-opensans.svg"
  alt="Example of Open Sans font"
/>

The design system uses the open-source, sans-serif typeface **Open Sans**.

<Image
  src="/img/foundations/typography-ptmono.svg"
  alt="Example of PT Mono font"
/>

**PT Mono** is used to represent code snippets only, and therefore should not be used in any other context. PT Mono is a monospace typeface that displays all characters within the same width.

## Styles

#### Display

Display styles are primarily reserved for representing key metrics and mastheads.

#### Headings

Headings provide varying levels of typographic hierarchy.

<Image

  alt="Graphical representation of Body and Label styles"
/>
#### Body 

Body is the default style for most components and text blocks.

#### Label

Labels are used to display a small amount of text that helps people understand the current context of a component.

#### Help

Help text is used to provide additional information or instructions, such as accepted data formats for an input or file types for upload.

#### Code

The code text style is used to display code in a clear format.

## Color

Legibility and accessibility is a key consideration within the design system. with this in mind, each mode provides two color options: primary and secondary. Both of these options are selected from the neutral palette. These colors are consistently applied throughout the design system.

<Image
  src="/img/foundations/typography-colors.svg"
  alt="Example of type color options"
/>

### Primary foreground

The primary text color should be used by default and make up the majority of text within any composition. It provides the greatest level of contrast between foreground and background.

### Secondary foreground

Secondary text should be used sparingly. It is intended to only be used for supporting text, or to provide contrast between labels and data.

Use primary and secondary text colors and/or weight variants to create visual hierarchy.
  
</AdviceCallout>

All text within the design system meets WCAG 2.0 level AA requirements in order to ensure legibility.

WCAG 2.0 requires that the contrast ratio between text and the background it sits on is at least 4.5:1 for normal sized text and 3:1 for larger text.

<AdviceCallout type="negative">

Don’t use color alone to infer meaning. Color blind and low vision users may not be able to perceive the difference, and screen readers do not announce colors to non-sighted readers.

## Line height

As with most aspects of the design system, type conforms to density. Each style grows proportionately to align with the elements around it. Line height and the spaces between blocks of text also adhere to density.

Line height controls the amount of space between baselines within a block of text. The height of a line of text is proportional to the text size.

In order to scale consistently across all styles, weights and densities, line height is set to a multiple of the font size. The multiple is set to 1.3x. This balances the need for a moderate degree of information density with the need to create enough visual separation between lines of text to enable efficient line tracking when reading blocks of text.

## Weight

Weight refers to the relative thickness of a font’s stroke. Each style includes three weights, enabling the default style to either be emphasised or de-emphasised to help create visual hiearachy.

<DesignCards>

<DesignCard
      src="/img/foundations/typography-weight-small.svg"
      alt="Example of text displayed in small weight"
>

Small offers a subtler option, providing a lighter weight for each type style. Small can be used to de-emphasise secondary text such as footnotes or supporting instructions.

</DesignCard>
  
<DesignCard
       src="/img/foundations/typography-weight-default.svg"
      alt="Example of text displayed in default weight"
>

By default, all text within the block would be the same level of emphasis.

</DesignCard>
  
<DesignCard
       src="/img/foundations/typography-weight-strong.svg"
      alt="Example of text displayed in strong weight"
>

The strong weight provides the ability for each font style to be emphasised. This can help guide a reader to take note of specific words or phrases. Alternatively, it can allow greater focus to be placed on an entire header of block of text in order to establish a visual hierarchy.

## Alignment

Type alignment controls how text aligns in the space it appears. There are four types of alignment: left, right, centered and justified.

### Left-aligned

Text aligned to the left is the default configuration for left-to-right (LTR) languages, such as English.

### Right-aligned

Right align text for right-to-left (RTL) languages, such as Arabic or Hebrew. It should also be used for Numeric values (including dates, times, and currency figures) when the intention is to carry out comparisons within a data set, for instance within a data grid column. If a numeric value is displayed in isolation, and therefore not for comparison, it should be left aligned to fit in with the content around it.


<AdviceCallout type="positive">

  alt="Example of right aligned text"
/>
Right align numerical values and corresponding headers within data grid columns.
  
</AdviceCallout>

### Center-aligned

Center aligned text should be reserved for short sentences or blocks of text included as a typographic element, such as a pull quote or key metric. Avoid center-aligning large blocks of text or headings. When longer text is centered, readers are forced into additional eye movements on both sides of the text, resulting in unnecessary eye fatigue and lower reading accuracy.

### Justified text

The use of justified text is not encouraged, but if required for a more formal aesthetic or to align to print materials, consider enabling hyphenation to balance negative space and avoid large gaps between words.

## Line length

When including paragraphs of text within a design, it should be laid-out in a way that accommodates the intended reader. Shorter line lengths are typically more comfortable for the majority of readers and scenarios. With longer line lengths a reader's eyes have to travel further from the end of one line to the start of the next. This can make it hard to track progress and has been shown to cause fatigue (Baymard Institue, 2022).

Based on research and accessibility guidelines, a line length of between **60-80 characters per line** (CPL) is recommended.

Shorter line lengths can enable more focused reading and accuracy of understanding. However, too narrow means the eye must travel back too often, breaking the reader’s rhythm. This tends to cause stress for readers, making them begin the next line before finishing the current one. This can also mean they skip important words.

Our recommendation is for the absolute minimum width of a block of text to be **no less than 45 CPL**.

Longer lines can be better suited for cases where the information is more likely to be scanned and accuracy is less important. If a line is too long, a reader’s eyes will have a tougher time focusing on the text. Because the line length makes it hard to judge where the line starts and ends, it can be difficult to continue onto the correct line in large blocks of text.

We recommend that no block of text exceeds **a maximum of 100 CPL**.

/>

Within the design system, the columns defined in ‘layouts’ have been designed to accommodate these recommendations across all densities.

## Case

There are three cases recommended within our content guidelines: sentence case, title case and all capitals.

### Sentence case

Use sentence case in most instances—for body copy, page titles, navigation, subheadings, form titles, field labels, and chart/data visualization titles and text.

### Title case

The only words you should capitalize or put in title case are proper nouns and job titles. A proper noun is an individual, company, product or object that’s one of a kind.

### All capitals

All caps are reserved for button labels to give them prominence and to differentiate them from other graphical elements. Never use all caps in general writing.

<Image

  alt="Example of buttons with allcaps"
/>
<AdviceCallout type="negative">

When referring to a button in written content, never use all caps.
  
</AdviceCallout>
<AdviceCallout type="positive">

When referring to a button in written content, capitalize the button label and apply emphasis using font weight.
  
</AdviceCallout>

## Italics

Italics are primarily used for help text to differentiate it from other text, such as labels within an input.

<Image
  src="/img/foundations/typography-italics.svg"
  alt="Example of italicized text"
/>

<AdviceCallout type="positive">

Italics should be used sparingly and only to highlight a specific word or short phrase.
  
</AdviceCallout>
  
<AdviceCallout type="positive">

For publication names, the introduction of new terms, etc., use quotation marks instead.
  
</AdviceCallout>

<AdviceCallout type="negative">

Don't italicize full sentences or blocks of text except when including help text with an input or selectable element, such as a radio button group.
  
</AdviceCallout>

<AdviceCallout type="negative">

Don’t use italics and font weight together to emphasize a word–use font weight alone to emphasize a word, use italics simply to differentiate it from the rest of the text.
