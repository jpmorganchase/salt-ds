Used well typography helps to enhance readability, establish hierarchy and set a visual tone, resulting in more effective communication.

The design system uses the open-source sans serif typeface **Open Sans**.

**PT Mono** is used to represent code snippets only, and therefore should not be used in any other context. PT Mono is a Monospace typeface that displays all characters within the same width.

## Type styles

#### Display
Display styles are primarily reserved for representing key metrics and mastheads. 

#### Headings
Headings provide varying levels of typographic hierarchy.

#### Body
Body is the default style for most components and text blocks.

#### Label
Labels are used to display a small amount of text that helps people understand the current context of a component.

#### Help
Help text is used to provide additional information or instructions, such as accepted data formats for a input or file types for upload. 

#### Code
Code is used to highlight any text that represents code. 

## Type and color
Legibility and accessibility is a key consideration within the design system. with this in mind, each mode provides two color options; primary and secondary, both of which are selected from the neutral palette. These colors are consistently applied throughout the design system.

### Primary foreground
The primary text color should be used by default and make up the majority of text within any composition. It provides the greatest level of contrast between foreground and background.

### Secondary foreground
Secondary text should be used sparingly. It is intended to only be used for supporting text or to provide contrast between labels and data.

Form field labels use secondary text in order to give greater prominence to the entered value.

Secondary text used for labels to ensure data has greater prominence, without the need for differing weights or font sizes.

### Legibility and accessibility
All text within the design system meets WCAG 2.0 level AA requirements in order to ensure legibility. 

WCAG 2.0 requires that the contrast ratio between text and the background it sits on is at least 4.5:1 for normal sized text and 3:1 for larger text. 

## Line height
As with most aspects of the design system, type conforms to density. Each style grows proportionately to align with the elements around it. Line height and the spaces between blocks of text also adhere to density. 

Line height controls the amount of space between baselines within a block of text. THe height of a line of text is proportional to the text size. 

In order to scale consistently across all styles, weights and densities, line height is set to a multiple of the font size. The multiple is set to 1.3x to balance the need for a moderate degree of information density with the need to create enough visual separation between lines of text to enable efficient line tracking when reading blocks of text.

## Font weight
Weight refers to the relative thickness of a font’s stroke. Each style includes three weights, enabling the default style to either be emphasised or de-emphasised to help create visual hiearachy.

Small offers a subtler option, providing a lighter weight for each type style. Small can be used to de-emphasise secondary text such as footnotes or supporting instructions.

<DesignCard

SBy default all text within the block would be the same level of emphasis.

<DesignCard
       src="/img/foundations/typography-weight-strong.svg"
      alt="Example of text displayed in strong weight"

The strong weight provides the ability for each font style to be emphasised. This can help guide a reader to take note of specific words or phrases. Alternatively, it can allow greater focus to be placed on an entire header of block of text in order to establish a visual hierarchy.

## Type alignment
Type alignment controls how text aligns in the space it appears. There are four types of alignment; left, right, centered and justified.

### Left-aligned
Text aligned to the left is the default configuration for left-to-right languages such as English.

### Right-aligned
Numeric values (including dates, times, and currency figures) should be right aligned if they are meant to be compared with each other, for instance within a data grid column. If a numeric value is displayed in isolation, and therefore not for comparison, it should be left aligned to fit in with the content around it.

### Center-aligned
Center aligned text should be reserved for short sentences or blocks of text included as a typographic element within a layout, such as a pull quote or key metric. It should never be used for long paragraphs or headings.

## Type case
There are three cases recommended within our content guidelines: sentence case, title case and all capitals.

### Sentence case
Use sentence case in most instances—for body copy, page titles, navigation, subheadings, form titles, field labels, and chart/data visualization titles and text.

### Title case
The only words you should capitalize or put in title case are proper nouns and job titles. A proper noun is an individual, company, product or object that’s one of a kind.

### All capitals
All caps are reserved for button labels to give them prominence and to differentiate them from other graphical elements. Never use all caps in general writing. 

## Italicizing text
Italics are primarily used for help text, to differentiate it from other text such as labels within an input.
