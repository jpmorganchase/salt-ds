Colors can be used to communicate meaning, establish visual hierarchy, and differentiate products, all while ensuring a cohesive and accessible experience. Colors are divided into several categories to communicate several concepts across the Salt design system.

The raw color values on this page reference the current Salt theme. If you’re using the Salt Next theme please refer to the separate color palette and listed guidance on the [Themes page](/salt/themes/index).

## Status

Status colors help users understand what’s happening, what actions are needed, and whether any issues need to be addressed. They can be used to reflect changes in the state or condition of a system or process.

The Salt design system includes 4 statuses with corresponding colors:

| Status  | Color                               |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Info    | Accent (Blue or teal in Next theme) |
| Error   | Red                                 |
| Warning | Orange                              |
| Success | Green                               |

## Sentiment

Sentiment colors guide users through an interface by providing visual cues about potential outcomes. These colors evoke specific feelings such as negativity, carefulness, comfort, trust or positivity.

The Salt design system includes 5 sentiments with associated colors:

| Sentiment | Color                     | Feeling     |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Negative  | Red                       | Negativity  |
| Caution   | Orange                    | Carefulness |
| Neutral   | Gray                      | Comfort     |
| Accented  | Blue (Teal in Next theme) | Trust       |
| Positive  | Green                     | Positivity  |

Sentiment can be used independently of status. For example, a negative button for 'Delete' could be displayed within an informative dialog.
