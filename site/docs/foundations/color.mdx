Colors can be used to communicate meaning, establish visual hierarchy, and differentiate products, all while ensuring a cohesive and accessible experience. Colors are divided into several categories to communicate several concepts across the Salt design system.

The raw color values on this page reference the current Salt theme. If you’re using the Salt Next theme please refer to the separate color palette and listed guidance on the [Themes page](/salt/theming/index).

## Status

Status is a visual indicator or cue that reflects changes in the state or condition of a system or process. These colors are crucial to help users understand what’s happening, what actions are needed, and whether any issues need to be addressed.

The Salt design system includes 4 statuses with corresponding colors:

1. Info = Accent (Blue or teal in Next theme)
1. Error = Red
1. Warning = Orange
1. Success = Green

## Sentiment

Sentiment refers to the emotional response or attitude that users experience when interacting with an interface. These colors evoke specific feelings such as positivity, negativity, comfort or trust. Sentiment colors guide users through the interface by influencing user perception and behavior.

The Salt design system includes 5 sentiments with associated colors:

1. Negative = Red (Negativity)
1. Caution = Orange (Carefulness)
1. Neutral = Gray (Comfort)
1. Accented = Blue (Trust) (Teal in Next theme to reflect JPM Brand)
1. Positive = Green (Positivity)

Sentiment can be used independently of status. For example, a negative button for 'Delete' could be displayed within an informative dialog.

## Neutrality

Neutral colors are used for the majority of the UI design, and allows accents to stand out. This includes background colors, the gray ramp, and the use of white and black.

## Foundation

<FoundationColorView group="foundation" />

## Categorical

<FoundationColorView group="categorical" />
