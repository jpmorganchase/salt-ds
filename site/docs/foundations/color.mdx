Colors can be used to communicate meaning, suggest a visual hierarchy, and help distinguish our products from others while providing a cohesive and accessible experience. In the Salt design system, colors are divided into several categories to convey different concepts.

The colors referenced on this page are part of the Salt legacy color library.

## Foundation

<FoundationColorView group="foundation" />

## Categorical

<FoundationColorView group="categorical" />
