Colors can be used to communicate meaning, establish visual hierarchy, and differentiate products, all while ensuring a cohesive and accessible experience. Colors are divided into several categories to communicate several concepts across the Salt design system.

The colors on this page reference the current Salt theme. If you’re using the Salt Next theme please refer to the separate color palette and listed guidance on the [Themes page](/salt/theming/index). 

## Status

Status is a visual indicator or cue that communicates the current state or condition of a system, component, or process to the user. It helps users understand what’s happening in the interface, whether it be the progress of a task, the availability of a feature or the success of an action. Status can be used independent of sentiment. 

The Salt design system has 4 statuses: 

1. Success = green
1. Info = accent (blue or teal)
1. Warning = orange
1. Error = red

## Sentiment

Sentiment differs from status in that it’s the emotional response or attitude that users experience when interacting with an interface. It encompasses how components and design elements evoke feelings of positivity, negativity, comfort, trust, or frustration in users. It should always communicate important information. 

The Salt design system has 5 sentiments and corresponding colors associated with each:

1. Negative = red (negativity)
1. Caution = orange (carefulness)
1. Neutral = gray (comfort)
1. Accented = teal or blue (trust)
1. Positive = green (positivity)

## Neutrality 

Neutral colors are used for the majority of the UI design, and allows accents to stand out. This includes background colors, the gray ramp, and the use of white and black.
