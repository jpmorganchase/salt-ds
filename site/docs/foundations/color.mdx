Colors can be used to communicate meaning, suggest a visual hierarchy, and help distinguish products from others while providing a cohesive and accessible experience. In the Salt design system, colors are divided into several categories to convey different concepts. 

The colors referenced on this page are part of the Salt legacy color library. If you are using the Salt Next theme please refer to the separate color palette and listed guidance on the [Theming page](/salt/theming/index). 

## Status

Status is a visual indicator or cue that communicates the current state or condition of a system, component or process to the user. Status helps users to understand whatâ€™s happening in the interface, whether it be the progress of a task, availability of a feature or the success of an action. It can be used independent of sentiment. 

The Salt design system has 4 status types: 

1. Success = green
1. Info = accent (blue or teal)
1. Warning = orange
1. Error = red

## Sentiment

Sentiment differs from status in that it is the emotional response or attitude that users experience when interacting with a user interface. It encompasses how components and design elements evoke feelings of positivity, negativity, comfort, trust, or frustration in users. It should always communicate important information. 

The Salt design system has 5 sentiment types and corresponding colors associated with each:

1. Negative = red (negativity)
1. Caution = orange (carefulness)
1. Neutral = gray (comfort)
1. Accented = teal or blue (trust)
1. Positive = green (positivity)
