Modes allow the color palette to be changed from light to dark, providing the flexibility to choose an option that best fits a preference or need. Choosing the right mode can improve accessibility, reduce eye strain in low light conditions, or increase reading speed.

The following example demonstrates the two available modes. Each mode shares the same components and design tokens, with just the colors changing dependent on which mode is specified.

## Light mode

Light mode works well when users are likely to visit your application content on a semi-regular basis. It appears more open, familiar and friendly but may cause eyestrain when viewed for lengthy periods.

## Dark mode

If you're designing an interface that will be used continuously for long periods, consider applying a dark mode. It may be easier on the eye in certain environments, but you'll have to assess the overall impact to ensure that it’s not too daunting or overwhelming to users.

## Backgrounds

Each mode includes two background options; primary and secondary. The two backgrounds allow for color layering which can be used to separate regions or blocks of content and can help to establish a visual hierarchy.

| Token  | Light mode  | Dark mode  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| `container-primary-background` | `color-white` | `color-gray-800` | 
| `container-secondary-background` | `color-gray-20` | `color-gray-600` | 

## 60:30:10 rule

Aim to balance the use of color by following the ratio 60:30:10. This is a simple rule that helps create a well-balanced design.

- **60% primary (or dominant) color** - this should be the neutral primary background color, this forms the base color of a design
- **30% secondary color** - the secondary background should be used to define areas of focus, for instance, a summary panel, a set of high level metrics, a toolbar or navigation
- **10% accent color** - the portion of the ratio should be used to draw the eye to specific and important elements, such as a call-to-action, a prominent heading, image or data visualisation.

| Annotation  | Percentage  | Usage  | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 1 | 60% | Primary background color | 
| 2 | 30% | Highlighted region |
| 3 | 10% | Navigation accent bar and call-to-action |
