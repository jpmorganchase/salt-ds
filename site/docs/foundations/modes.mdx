Modes allow the color palette to be changed from light to dark, providing the flexibility to choose an option that best fits a preference or need. Choosing the right mode can improve accessibility, reduce eye strain in low light conditions, or increase reading speed.  

## Light mode
Light mode works well when users are likely to visit your application content on a semi-regular basis. It appears more open, familiar and friendly but may cause eyestrain when viewed for lengthy periods.

## Dark mode
If you're designing an interface that will be used continuously for long periods, consider applying a dark mode. It may be easier on the eye in certain environments, but you'll have to assess the overall impact to ensure that itâ€™s not too daunting or overwhelming to users.
