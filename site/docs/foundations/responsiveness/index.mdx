A responsive layout grid is made up of a set of consistently proportioned columns, separated by gutters, and flanked by margins. Basic layout grids are included in the design system to provide a starting point for designing any user interface.

The number of columns and their widths vary depending on the density and breakpoint set. Learn more information about Salt densities in the [density foundation](/salt/foundations/density).

| Columns      | The space that divides the content of the page into numbers depending on the content width for that breakpoint                |
| Gutters      | The equally distributed space between columns that defines the width of UI elements                                           |
| Margins      | The left and right spacing on the edge of the screen that defines the distance between UI elements and their container bounda |

## Types of grid

**Fixed grid**: As you shrink from desktop to tablet, the layout remains unchanged, resulting in larger side margins. Text doesn’t wrap, images retain their dimensions, and components have a set width, not adapting to the viewport size. Fixed grid is recommended for web design.

**Fluid grid**: As you shrink the window size, the layout adjusts dynamically, with text wrapping and elements narrowing. Components have a percentage width to adjust to the user’s screen resolution. Fluid grid is best suited for dashboard design.
