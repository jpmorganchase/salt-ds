Understanding semantic characteristics means learning how to read token names, so you can easily find and use the right token in both design and code.

<Callout status="warning" title="Don't">
  Don’t choose a token just because its color looks right—this can cause issues
  in other themes or modes. Instead, design semantically. Rather than coloring
  something red, identify it as being in an ‘error’ state, needing ‘attention’,
  or a ‘negative’ change or message.

All semantic characteristic tokens in the Salt Design System follow this format:

1. **Design system prefix:** A mandatory term that clearly attributes the token to Salt
2. **Characteristic:** A mandatory term included in all semantic tokens in order to group tokens that share the same purpose or function (e.g., accent, actionable, container, content)
3. **Modifier:** An optional term that reflects changes in the condition of a system or process to convey details about the token's purpose, such as color function
4. **Emphasis:** An optional term that helps to indicate where visual prominence is increased or decreased (e.g., bold, subtle)
5. **Variant:** An optional term allowing variation within a set of attributes within a characteristic (e.g., primary, secondary, tertiary)
6. **Property:** A mandatory term to indicate the UI attribute the token applies to (e.g., background, border, shadow, foreground)
7. **State:** An optional term indicating the current condition of an element (e.g., hover, active, selected, disabled, read-only)

If a token name doesn’t include a modifier, emphasis, variant or state, it represents the ‘default’ value. However, Salt avoids using the term ‘default’ in token names, as it can be ambiguous and doesn’t clearly describe the token’s purpose or usage. This approach helps keep token naming clear and specific.

## Characteristic

Semantic characteristics are groups of tokens that share the same purpose or intent. In Salt, every characteristic token includes its semantic group directly after the design system prefix, e.g., --salt-content-primary-foreground. Below are the semantic characteristics used in Salt:

- Actionable
- Category
- Container
- Content
- Editable
- Focused
- Navigable
- Overlayable
- Selectable
- Sentiment
- Separable
- Status
- Target
- Text

## Modifier

Modifiers such as sentiment, status and category are included in the list of characteristic tokens and are based on subsets of these groups. Modifiers can be used to indicate changes in a system or process, helping to convey details about a token’s purpose, such as its color function or interaction state.

### Sentiment

Each sentiment in Salt is designed to evoke a particular feeling, such as negativity, caution or positivity. Salt includes five sentiments: Accented, Caution, Negative, Positive and Neutral. Like ‘default’ states, Neutral is implied when no sentiment is specified. Therefore, it's never explicitly named within a token.

### Status

Status in Salt describes the condition of a system or process. Each status helps users understand what’s happening, what actions may be needed, and whether any issues require attention. The four statuses are: Error, Info, Success and Warning.

### Category

Category provides a set of 20 numbered groups. These groups don't have predefined meanings, so you can assign significance locally, such as for tagging content or organizing data visualizations. Each category is represented by a number to avoid implying any system-level meaning or color, since colors may change across themes and modes.

## Emphasis

Emphasis is an optional term used to adjust the visual prominence of an attribute when needed. In design tokens, emphasis is shown as either bold or subtle, with the default value used if neither is specified. Bold increases emphasis, whereas subtle decreases it. How emphasis appears may differ depending on the characteristic or property.

## Variant

Variant is an optional term with three values: primary, secondary and tertiary. Variants help distinguish and customize design elements, providing flexibility in both styling and functionality.

## Property

Property refers to the specific attribute to which a design token applies, such as background, foreground or border. In Salt, foreground covers both text and icons. When you need to differentiate between them, the states 'informative' (for text) and 'decorative' (for icons) are used alongside 'foreground'. This approach allows for subtle color differences between text and icons, while ensuring compliance with color contrast requirements.

## State

State refers to the condition of a design attribute, such as hover, disabled, active, selected or read-only. If no state is specified, it is considered the ‘default’ value.
