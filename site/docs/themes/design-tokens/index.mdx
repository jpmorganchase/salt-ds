Salt styles its components and patterns using design tokens. Design tokens are name and value pairings that capture small, repeatable design choices—such as colors, fonts, and spacing—and are essential for storing key style attributes in a design system. They help maintain consistency across platforms and applications, making it easier to update and maintain a cohesive look throughout your products.

## Why we use tokens

There are several benefits to using design tokens instead of static values:

- Consistency: Ensures visual harmony across products, boosting recognition and trust.
- Efficiency: Accelerates design changes across platforms, saving time and effort.
- Flexibility: Allows modifications without extensive code changes.
- Scalability: Centralizes property definitions, streamlining the design system.

Design tokens are adaptable building blocks that capture design decisions as name-value pairs. Their names and usage stay the same even if the values change—for example, when switching from light to dark mode or applying a different theme—making it easier for designers and developers to work together and maintain consistency.

## How tokens are structured

Salt uses a tiered token structure to provide flexibility with mode, theme, and density options. The token tiers—Foundations, Palettes, and Semantic Characteristics—make it easy to adjust styles and settings across components, ensuring consistency and adaptability throughout your application.

### Foundations

Foundation tokens are the base-level tokens that reference the raw values at the core of the design system. For more information about each foundation, see the [Foundations](/salt/foundations/index) section.

### Palettes

Palette tokens are collections of commonly used foundation tokens and are referenced by semantic characteristic tokens. A palette token can point to different foundation tokens, allowing components to switch between light and dark modes.

### Semantic characteristics

Semantic characteristics are groups of tokens that serve a specific purpose or intent, such as styling error, warning, info, and success states. These tokens define design elements by their meaning or use, making it easy to adapt styles without altering the underlying logic. Characteristics typically reference palette tokens, and may reference foundation tokens when needed—for example, when styling typography where mode switching isn’t required.

## Design tokens in Figma

In Figma, design tokens are shown as variables that closely align with the tokens used in code. Although their format as variables is different from code, you read and use them in the same way.

The Dev Mode experience in Figma displays code syntax for each variable, making it easy for developers to see the exact code snippet and corresponding design token when inspecting a design.

## Extent of design tokens

To keep the number of design tokens manageable, Salt doesn't create tokens for every attribute of every component and state. Instead, Salt provides tokens that capture the system’s overall design intent. This approach helps maintain a cohesive, systematic design and supports high-quality interaction patterns and accessibility.
