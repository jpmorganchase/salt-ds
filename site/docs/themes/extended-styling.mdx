Salt makes it easy to customize your UI while keeping everything consistent and maintainable. You can adjust densities, switch themes, and choose between light and dark modes. Most components offer props that help to establish clear hierarchy or alter prominence, with predefined variants and appearances to fit different situations. There are also semantic color options for sentiment, status, and categories—giving you plenty of flexibility without needing to override.

## Overriding tokens

You can create a new theme in Salt by directly overriding Foundation, Palette, or Characteristic design tokens. This approach requires strong knowledge of the system, careful design work, and a plan for ongoing support. If you choose to modify themes, you're responsible for meeting accessibility standards and thoroughly testing your changes.

In Figma, custom components should be created and published separately. In code, use a centralized CSS stylesheet with your changes imported alongside the Salt theme.

Customizing the Legacy (UITK) theme isn't recommended, as its token structure isn't designed for theming. Any customization is at your own risk and must be maintained by you.

## Custom themes aren't recommended

You can customize themes in Salt by adjusting design tokens to change the look and feel of UI components. However, creating custom themes isn't recommended. If you decide to override tokens, you're responsible for keeping those styles updated in both code and Figma, and you take on the risk and effort of ongoing maintenance. Salt’s visual design strategy centers on the JPM Brand theme for long-term use and the Legacy (UITK) theme to support migration from the previous design system.

## White-labeling isn't supported

White labeling is the process of customizing a design system so another company can use it with their own visual style and branding, while keeping the core code and features the same. This allows organizations to adapt the system to match their identity without building everything from scratch. However, white labeling requires significant changes and ongoing maintenance, as each component must be rebuilt and new design libraries managed. Because of these complexities, Salt doesn't support white labeling and instead focuses on maintaining a consistent, cohesive design system.
