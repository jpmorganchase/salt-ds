# Layouts

Page layouts should go in this folder.

## File structure

If layouts have additional files associated with them, such as styles, those should be placed in the same folder.

The folder must have the same name as the corresponding layout.

```bash
site/
└── src/
    └── layouts/
        └── [layout_name]/
            ├── [LayoutName].tsx
            └── [LayoutName].module.css
```
