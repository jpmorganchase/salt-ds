/*
  Rendered markdown always seems to be wrapped in
  <div class="wrapper"><div>...</div></div> (sigh!).
  So, to select the first item _within_ the actual rendered markdown, we need
  to use this lenghty selector:
*/
.tabPanel > :global(.wrapper) > div > :first-child {
  /*
    Ensure there is an appropriate minimum space between the Tabs and the
    content below, so that if the first thing happens to not be a heading, it
    doesn't butt up against the Tabs. (3x is the same as H3's margin-top)
  */
  margin-top: calc(var(--salt-size-unit) * 3);
}
