# Component props

This folder contains `json` files for the props generated by `propsGen.js`. They're used by the `PropsTable.tsx` component to create a table in the component docs within the "How to use" tab.

## Adding new component packages

New component packages (e.g. lab) can be added by editing the `componentPackages` array in `propsGen.js`.
