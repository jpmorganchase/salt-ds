Density relates to the amount of content that can fit on a screen based on the size and spacing of components.

## Densities

### High density (HD)
Scales components down to their smallest size. High density is optimized for data-heavy or complex applications, for instance, trading platforms. 

### Medium density (MD)
Medium density is the default solution for the majority of use cases. It is ideal for most standard applications or content rich websites.

### Low density (LD) 
Low density is optimized for data or content light interfaces. It's ideal for marketing, communications, or onboarding experiences. 

### Touch density (TD) 
Touch density scales components to their largest increment, and is intended only for mobile or tablet devices.
