    Button is an interactive component that allows the user to execute an
    action. There are three Button variants—CTA (call to action), primary and

### Best practises

#### When a Button has both an icon and a label

- Pass `aria-hidden=”true”` to the icon so that its label is not announced by screen readers.

#### When a Button has an icon only and no label

- Pass an `aria-label` to Button that describes its purpose.

### Keyboard interactions

| Key                                  | Function                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>                       | - If focus is above the button, Tab key press moves focus onto the button.<br/>- If the button is disabled and is set to receive focus, receives focus.<br/>- If the button has focus, Tab moves focus out of the button, to next focusable component in the tab order. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>  | - If focused, Tab+Shift combo moves focus out of the component to the previous component in the tab order.                                                                                                                                                              |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> | - If the button has focus, Enter or Space key press activates the button.<br/>- If the button is disabled and can receive focus, does nothing.                                                                                                                          |
